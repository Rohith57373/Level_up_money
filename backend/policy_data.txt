Eligibility Criteria:
- To receive a Stafford Loan, a student borr ower must meet the basic eligibility
- requirements for FSA funds (citizenship, Selective Service registration if
- applicable, etc.).  In addition, the student must be enr olled at least half time to
- receive a loan.  A parent borrower must meet certain nonacademic requirements,
- such as citizenship, while the student who is to benefit from the PLUS loan mustbe enrolled at least half time and otherwise eligible to receive FSA funds.  UnlikePell Grants, the loan amounts do not vary by enrollment status (though thestudent must be enrolled at least half time for Stafford and PLUS loan purposes).Borrower Eligibility
- for Stafford andPLUS loans
- To receive a Stafford Loan or to benefit from a PLUS Loan, a
- student must meet the general eligibility criteria for all FSA programs,as explained in Volume 1: Student Eligibility.  In particular, note that a
- student or a parent who owes a re payment on an FSA grant or is in
- default on an FSA loan is ineligible for additional FSA funds. Inaddition, the parents may not receive a PLUS Loan for the student’s
- benefit if the student owes a re payment on an FSA grant or is in
- default on an FSA loan.  H owever, if the defaulted borrower repays
- the loan or makes satisfactory arrangements to repay the loan, he or

- FFEL—34 CFR 682.603Direct Loans—34 CFR 685.301
- Ch. 2:  Borrower Eligibility for Stafford and PLUS Loans
- FSA Handbook    8–15*NEW*  For example, your school cannot engage in a policy of
- certifying  Stafford loans only in the amount needed to cover the
- school charges, or a policy of limiting unsubsidized Stafford
- borrowing by independent students.
- A student who is otherwise eligible for a subsidized Stafford Loan
- FFEL lender willing to make such a loan, should contact the guaranty
- state in which the student’s school is located. The guaranty agency
- the student within 60 days. An LLR cannot make a loan that exceeds
- the borrower’s need, nor is it required to make a loan for an amountless than $200. The LLR, as with any other lender, may refuse to make
- the loan if the borrower fails to meet the lender’s credit standards.
- LOAN FEES
- principal amount of the loan to the federal government.  These feeswere instituted in 1981 as a means of defraying the cost of the loan
- loan disbursements.  Thus, if a lender deducts the 3% originationfee from a $2,000 Stafford Loan that is to be paid in two
- installments, the student will receive payments of $970 and  $970.
- (However, NSLDS will show the full value of the loan, $2,000, andreport each disbursement as $1,000.)
- an insurance fee (not to exceed 1% of the loan).  If the guarantor
- charges an insurance fee for its Stafford and PLUS loans, the lender
- may pass on the charge to the borrower.
- The Direct Subsidized and Unsubsidized Loans include a “loan
- fee,” which is currently 3% of the principal amount of the loan.  InDirect Loans, the loan fee for a PLUS is 4%.
- When packaging, the amount of any loan fees that were
- deducted from the loan must be included in the student’s cost of
- the origination fee from Stafford loan disbursements,  but it must
- observe a consistent policy for all of the Stafford Loans that it makes
- to borrowers who live in the same state or attend school in the
- same state.Aside from the borrower’s state of residence or the state where
- the school is located, the lender is only permitted to make adistinction for two categories of borrowers—it may choose notto deduct the full origination fee for its borrowers who qualify

Application Process:
- However, t here are three exceptions that apply to Stafford and PLUS
- loans.
- • Undergraduate preparatory work.   A student may apply for a
- Stafford Loan for up to 12 months of coursework taken in a
- single consecutive period if the school has documented that the
- coursework is necessary in order for the student to enroll in anundergraduate degree or certificate program. This category of
- students may borrow at the first-year undergraduate loan level,
- • Graduate/professional preparatory work.   A student may apply
- for a Stafford Loan for up to 12 months of coursework taken in
- documented that the coursework is necessary in order for thestudent to enroll in a graduate or professional program. This
- category of students may borrow at the fifth-year undergraduate
- loan level,  and the loan limit is not prorated if the program isless than an academic year.
- • Coursework required for teacher certification.   A student with a
- secondary level may apply for a Stafford Loan. The school’srecords must indicate that the courses taken are required by the
- state where the student will be teaching. Such students may
- borrow at the fifth-year undergraduate loan level, and the loanlimit is not prorated if the program is less than an academic
- A student is ineligible  to receive a Stafford Loan or a Federal
- Perkins Loan (see the FSA Handbook: Campus-Based Programs Reference )
- not apply to students in dental internship programs.
- SUBSIDIZED AND UNSUBSIDIZED LOANS
- student loan during in-school status, grace periods, and authorized
- deferment periods.  To qualify for a subsidized Stafford Loan, a
- student must have financial need.
- A borrower unable to qualify based on need for a subsidized
- Stafford Loan may apply for an unsubsidized Stafford Loan, which is
- not based on need.  Also, a student able to qualify for only a part of
- the subsidized Stafford Loan limit may apply for an unsubsidized
- Stafford Loan to cover the EFC and any unmet financial need (up to
- the annual loan limit).
- An unsubsidized  student loan does not qualify for the interest
- subsidy that the federal government pays on a subsidized loan
- student with a $1,000 unsubsidized Stafford will receive the sameeducational benefit as a student with a $1,000 subsidized Stafford,
- the cost of repaying the loan will be higher.   Note that all PLUS
- loans are unsubsidized loans.
- loan will be capitalized and added to the principal balance.  Astudent can reduce interest costs on the loan by continuing to makeNeed and religious orders

- period, rather than a single payment period as in Pell.  For instance,if a student enrolls on January 10, 2003 and the last payment period
- $12,000, and,  based on her need, she qualifies for a subsidizedStafford Loan of $2,000.  She may also apply for an unsubsidized
- Stafford Loan of $625, which is the difference between the amount
- of her subsidized Stafford Loan ($2,000) and the Stafford Loan limit($2,625) for a first-year undergraduate.  Her parents may borrow aPLUS Loan to cover the remainder of the COA.

- Estimated Financial Assistance
- The student’s estimated financial assistance is the amount of aid
- he or she will receive for the enrollment period covered by the loan.The Pell Grant and most other sources of state, federal, private, and
- institutional financial aid are considered part of the estimated
- financial assistance  that reduces the student’s overall financial need.
- When certifying a loan, you have to subtract the student’s estimated
- financial assistance from the cost of attendance, regardless of
- whether the loan is subsidized or unsubsidized.
- Most forms of aid are easy to recognize, usually taking the form
- of scholarships, grants, work, or loans that are awarded on the basisof postsecondary enrollment.  But there are two noteworthy
- Montgomery GI Bill active duty benefits (veterans’ educational
- benefits paid under Chapter 30 of Title 38) and National Service
- Education Awards (AmeriCorps)  and post-service AmeriCorps
- benefits are not counted in the estimated financial assistance forsubsidized Stafford L oans. H owever, you do include t hese benefits in
- the estimated financial assistance when certifying an unsubsidized
- Unsubsidized FSA loans and some other loans can be used to
- offset (substitute for) part or all of the student’s EFC for the FSA
- programs, in effect removing that amount of aid from Estimated
- Financial Assistance.  These loans are:
- •U nsubsidized Stafford Loans and PLUS borrowed for that
- student.
- •Loans made by the school to assist the student.
- •State-sponsored and private education loans.
- Note, however, that any amounts of these forms of aid that
- exceed the EFC must be counted as estimated financial assistance.
- Considering  grants and subsidized loans first
- The law requires aid administrators to find out whether the
- student is eligible for certain other FSA programs that would
- for a subsidized Stafford Loan or who have an EFC low enough toqualify for a Pell Grant.The lender must apply the same policy to its subsidized and
- unsubsidized S tafford Loans.

- How financial knowledge and skills are applied will take on different forms due to individuals’ varied skill levels,
- aspirations, and life circumstances. Financial know -how accompanied by  core skills —such as critical thinking,
- problem solving, self -awareness, and adaptability —can boost individual financial capability to improve financial
- well-being according to one’s own terms. While the end result will vary by individual, the same four qualities of
- financial well- being can be relevant for anyone (Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2015) :
- • Having control over day -to-day, month- to-month finances
- • Having the capacity to absorb a financial shock
- • Having the ability to remain on track to meet financial goals
- • Having the financial freedom to make the choices that allow one to enjoy life
- In general terms, the f inancial education industry recognizes t hat individual behavior  and working knowledge

- known and learned in order to navigate through real- life financial decisions.
- Why Is Financial Literacy Important?
- Financial literacy has significance for the financial conditions of individuals, families, and communities , so
- much so that the Financial Literacy and Education Commission responded to societal financial issues by
- launching a National Strategy for Financial Literacy in 2011. Restated in 2016, the strategy aims to support
- efforts for “sustained financial well- being for all Americans and families in the U.S.” (Financial Literacy and
- Education Commission, 2016, paragraph 2).
- THE SKILLS THAT MATTER in Adult Education  Issue Brief: Financial Literacy  3
- The following issues provide rationale for the need to address financial literacy:
- Daily actions impact financial circumstances.  Individuals make decisions  each day  that financial ly impact

- Limited English and cultural differences can pose barriers to financial success. Specialized financial
- have negative consequences  when addressing issues such as tax codes, using financial services, and using
- (or not using) credit. Limited English individuals or immigrants who are unfamiliar with United States  financial

- How financial knowledge and skills are applied will take on different forms due to individuals’ varied skill levels,
- aspirations, and life circumstances. Financial know -how accompanied by core skills —such as critical thinking,
- problem solving, self-awareness, and adaptability —can boost individual financial capability to improve financial
- well-being according to one’s own terms. While the end result will vary by individual, the same four qualities of
- financial well -being can be relevant for anyone ( Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2015) :
- • Having control over day -to-day, month-to-month finances
- • Having the capacity to absorb a financial shock
- • Having the ability to remain on track to meet financial goals
- • Having the financial freedom to make the choices that allow one to enjoy life
- In general terms, the financial education industry recognizes that individual behav ior and working knowledge
- are components of the financial literacy mix that leads to financial capability. A person can have knowledge
- personal finance concepts and developing skills, a third facet of financial literacy is the fluent use of what is
- known and learned in order to navigate through real-l ife financial decisions.
- Why Is Financial Literacy Important?
- Financial literacy has significance for the financial conditions of individuals, families, and communities, s o
- much so that the Financial Literacy and Education Commission responded to societal financial issues by
- launching a National Strategy for Financial Literacy in 2011. Restated i n 2016, the strategy aims to support
- efforts for “sustained financial well-being for all Americans and families in the U.S.” (Financial Literacy and
- Education Commission, 2016, paragraph 2).
- THE SKILLS THAT MATTER in Adult Education Issue Brief: Financial Literacy 200
- The following issues provide rationale for the need to address financial literacy:
- Daily actions impact financial circumstances. Individuals make decisions each day that financial ly impact
- individuals can significantly affect the ir ability to meet financial obligations and achieve financial aspirations for
- Limited English and cultural differences can pose barriers to financial success. Specialized financial
- have negative consequences when addressing issues such as tax codes, using financial services, and using
- (or not using) credit. Limited English individuals or immigrants who are unfamiliar with United States financial
- systems and language may rely on others for assistance, making those individuals vulnerable to fraud, unintentional errors, or missed opportunities (U.S. Government Accountability Office, 2010).
- Not everyone receives financial education. The reality is that not all adults receive quality instruction about
- basic personal finance concepts. The 2016 National Financial Capability Study indicated that a s of 2015, less
- than a third of American adults had been offered financial education at a school, college, or workplace, and only
- one in five say they participated in financial education.
- As of 2015, less than a third of American (FINRA Investor Education Foundation, 2016).

- How Do You Implement the Skills That Matter for Financial Literacy?
- Learners benefit from integrating financial literacy skills development with all of the skills that matter because
- this reinforces skills they will need when they have learned about personal financ e. A key to financial literacy is
- • Communication. Financial issues need to be addressed frequently in multiperson households.
- What Are Some Tips for Teaching Financial Literacy Skills in Your
- • Know your learners to bring relevance to the experience. Be practical in planning activities and
- new financial concepts, survey the group to identify skill level s, relevant experiences, and attitudes
- • Respect privacy and protect personal information. Some learners may be uncomfortable discuss ing
- personal financial issues. Others may find that class discussi ons encourage too much information
- sharing. Before addressing personal financial topics, establish boundaries and rules of engagement
- to introduce financial concepts and position personal finance topics in context. Whether based on real or
- personal financial advice during a class discussion. Be present during the presentation to help guide
- •   Establish boundaries. Be aware that your role is that of an educator, not that of a financial counselor
- or adviser. It is one thing to teach personal financ e skills and strategies for financial decision making,
- but engaging with students to coach and provide financial advice on specific personal issues could put
- you into a challenging position. A credentialed financial counselor or advisor is best qualified to provide
- expert assistance with personal financial issues. As an instructor, be open and upfront with learners
- about what you can and will not discuss regarding individual financial situations. Be the connector to

- Consumers need to read the fine print in ads because actual interest rates will vary due to factors such as
- length of loan and the buyer’s credit record. Consumers with good credit records might be offered lower
- interest rates. Investigating interest rate options available from more than one source provides reference
- auto loan from a source other than the dealership where the car is purchased. When deciding on length
- of the loan, think ahead to the value of the vehicle. Three to 5 years makes sense for a car loan rather than 8 years, for with an 8-year loan the car value could be less than the loan payments made in a year.
- Teach ing Tip #4

- uniformed service personnel  may be eligible  for VA home loan guaranty benefits . The full listing is
- available online at:  https://www.va.gov/housing -assistance/home -loans/eligibility/ .
- Is there a fee to use the VA Home Loan Guaranty?
- a program funding fee , which is a percentage of the total loan amount . This user fee varies based
- whether the loan is a first -time or subsequent (second, third, etc.)  use of the benefit . The funding fee
- may be paid in cash  or included in the loan at closing.
- *The funding fee can also be paid by the seller, lender, or any other party on your behalf.  (See

- What if I want to buy a home while I still have another VA Home Loan?
- While you can buy a home for any loan amount, you must either sell your previous  home or understand
- VA rules on subsequent purchases  and remaining entitlement . Those who purchase a subsequent home
- without selling their previous VA-guaranteed  home will continue t o follow their county conforming loan
- limit for the VA loan guaranty. This may mean a down payment on any amount above the loan limit.
- Note : You must be able to afford all your VA loans at the same time and the subsequent home must
- become your residence . (See Appendix D: Reusing the VA Loan  below  or this blog )
- Why choose VA?
- The VA Home Loan is often  the best home loan product for Veterans. Some benefits include:
- • No down payment  as long as the sales price is at or below the home’s appraised value ( the
- value set for the home after an expert review  of the property ) See VA Appraisal  section below
- • No loan limit with full entitlement if you can afford the loan, VA will back loans in all areas of

- payment is less than 20% of the total mortgage amount.
- o MIP is what the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) requires borrowers to pay to self -
- insure an FHA loan against future loss.
- o Not having to pay PMI could save a borrower on their monthly mortgage payment

- minimum credit score.
- Because d ifferent lenders have different requirements, feel free to shop around for a lender that meets
- your  financial and homebuying needs.

- • Buy a condo in a VA -approved project
- • Re-use a VA loan benefit if sell ing or refinanc ing a home bought with a VA -guaranteed  home
- loan ,

- buyer takes over the seller’s loan)
- Note on purchasing a condo : VA maintains a list of approved condos . If the condo is not on the
- list, the project must be submitted to VA for review to ensure that it complies with VA requirements.

- Paying yourself first requires discipline. It also entails prioritizing long-term financial security, which
- requires planning. To do so, you need to follow three steps: determine a financial goal that you want
- to achieve, consider how much you can afford, and create a savings plan to help you reach your goal.
- This process is something that begins with the idea of putting your future self and financial situation
- STEP ONE : Determine a Financial Goal
- term goals include saving for a small vacation, a car, a new device, or some renovations to your
- home. Long-term financial goals could include establishing an emergency fund, purchasing a home,

- includes debt that comes from investments in a variety of assets that are expected to appreciate
- in value. Examples include a mortgage for a primary residence, a loan for a college education, or a
- business loan to start or expand a profitable enterprise.
- financial situation and credit rating. An example of bad debt is maintaining a large balance on a high-
- interest credit card. Bad debt is a contingency that must be accounted for by all businesses that
- extend credit to customers, as there is always a risk that payment won’t be collected. Bad debt can
- occur when individuals either don’t make their monthly payments on high-interest credit cards in a
- timely manner or when they use loans for discretionary purchases like vacations or furniture.
- loan typically has an interest rate below 10 percent, whereas a credit card interest rate can be in
- excess of 25 percent. Banks and other financial institutions realize that their money isn’t as safe if
- has collateral to collect upon.
- Good debt is usually less risky than bad debt since it’s an investment and appreciates in value,
- offsetting the cost of the debt. Bad debt, however, decreases in value, and the balance on the
- debt can increase rapidly if not paid quickly due to less favorable interest rates and terms. All told,
- financial plan can be tough depending on the current economic environment.
- Good debt can have a positive impact on a person’s financial well-being and wealth, while bad
- debt can lead to financial difficulties and harm a person’s overall financial situation, including their
- credit score. However, it’s important to realize that not making payments on any type of debt can
- put a person in a worse position financially. All debt must be managed properly to have a minimal
- or positive impact on your credit score. This is important because lenders, landlords, and other
- financial institutions use credit scores to determine a person’s likelihood of repaying debt, and
- therefore whether they are a good candidate for a loan or line of credit. A higher credit score

- Eligibility for Direct Loans
- The purpose of this chapter is to describe the eligibility requirements forDirect Loan borrowers.  These requirements are in the Higher EducationAct of 1965, as amended (HEA), and in Title IV regulations.  Therequirements for student borrowers and parent borrowers differ.
- Student Borrower Eligibility
- Direct Subsidized Loans and Direct Unsubsidized Loans are forundergraduate students and graduate and professional students who meet:
- ✦general Title IV student eligibility requirements and
- ✦specific Direct Loan student eligibility requirements.
- Schools are responsible for assuring that students who receive Direct
- Loans meet these requirements.  This section briefly highlights several ofthe general requirements and then focuses on requirements that arespecific to the Direct Loan Program.
- Title IV Student Eligibility Requirements
- To receive any Title IV aid, including Direct Loans, students must meetgeneral regulatory requirements.  These requirements address issues suchas citizenship status, valid Social Security number (SSN), satisfactoryacademic progress, selective service registration, and certifications.  Thestudent eligibility section of EDs Student Financial Aid (SFA) Handbook

- September 1999Schools must be knowledgeable about these requirements so that ineligible
- students do not receive Direct Loans.  Although this guide does not repeatthe detailed information in the SFA Handbook , three featuresthe Free
- Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), dependency status, andfinancial needare presented here because they are basic elements thatschools use to determine student eligibility for Direct Loans.

- Eligibility for a Direct Subsidized Loan requires that a student demonstratefinancial need according to the need analysis formula in the HEA.Financial need is not, however, an eligibility criterion for DirectUnsubsidized Loans, Direct PLUS Loans, and Direct Consolidation Loans.
- Direct Loan Student Eligibility Requirements
- In addition to general Title IV student eligibility requirements, the DirectLoan Program has other eligibility criteria, concerning:
- ✦Federal Pell Grant eligibility,
- ✦previously canceled loans, and
- To obtain a Direct Subsidized Loan or Direct Unsubsidized Loan, a
- student must be:
- ✦enrolled at least half-time as a regular student,
- ✦at a school that participates in the Direct Loan Program. Laws & Regulations
- 5-4 Direct Loan School GuideChapter 5
- September 1999One exception to this requirement is for students enrolled in a course of
- study required to enroll in an eligible program.  However, receiving federalfinancial aid while enrolled in a preparatory program is limited to12 monthsspecifically, one consecutive 12-month period.
- Students are not eligible for Direct Loans if they are also enrolled in an
- elementary school, middle school, or secondary school.  Nor are studentseligible if they are incarcerated.  Although a postsecondary school mayparticipate simultaneously in both the Direct Loan Program and theFFEL Program, a student may not borrow from both programs to attendthe same school for the same loan period.
- Federal Pell Grant Eligibility
- When a student applies for a Direct Subsidized Loan or a DirectUnsubsidized Loan, a school must determine if the student is eligible orineligible for a Federal Pell Grant (gift aid).  The school must then includethe amount of an eligible students Federal Pell Grant as part of his or herestimated financial assistance when calculating how much the student canborrow from the Direct Loan Program.  (This Pell-eligibility check is notconducted when parents apply for Direct PLUS Loans.)
- Direct Subsidized Loan Eligibility
- A school awarding Direct Loan funds to a student must also determine thestudents eligibility for a Direct Subsidized Loan.  Unless the borrowerseligibility is $200 or less, he or she must be awarded a Direct SubsidizedLoanwhich does not accrue interest while the student is in school andduring the grace periodbefore being awarded a Direct UnsubsidizedLoanwhich accrues over the entire life of the loan.  (This Direct-Subsidized-Loan-eligibility check is not conducted when parents apply forDirect PLUS Loans.)
- Previously Discharged Loans
- A student whose previous federal education loan was discharged due tototal and permanent disability may reestablish eligibility by:
- ✦obtaining a certification from a physician that the borrower can

- borrower receives cannot be discharged in the future on the basisof any impairment present when the new loan is made, unless theimpairment substantially deteriorates.
- Borrowers are not eligible for federal student financial aid funds if they:
- ✦are in default on a federal student loan,
- ✦have inadvertently obtained federal student loan funds in excess of
- annual or aggregate loan limits, or
- The SFA Handbook discusses in detail default, borrowing in excess of loan
- limits, and overpayment.  It also explains what students can do to regaineligibility for Title IV aid, including Direct Loan Program funds.
- Borrowers who have declared bankruptcy do not have to reaffirm theirdischarged federal student loan or overpayment obligations to be eligiblefor federal Title IV student aid funds, including Direct Loans.  TheBankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 prohibits denial of aid solely on the basisof a bankruptcy discharge.

Application Process:
- Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
- To be considered for a Direct Subsidized Loan or a Direct UnsubsidizedLoan, a student must submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid(FAFSA).  The information on the FAFSA allows a school to determine astudents dependency status and financial need.  It also provides the schoolwith data to create a loan origination record.
- A first step in determining how much a student may borrowand whatkinds and amounts of Direct Loans a student qualifies foris to determinewhether the student is an independent student or a dependent student.
- By law, a student is dependent if he or she can answer No to all of the
- 1. Will you be at least 24 years old by December 31 of the award year?2. Are you married?3. Are you a graduate student or a professional student?4. Are you a veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces?5. Are you an orphan or a ward of the court or were you a ward of the
- If a student can answer No to all of these questions, he or she is a

- dependent student and is classified as an independent student.  Anindependent student is eligible to apply for a Direct Subsidized Loan and aDirect Unsubsidized Loan and has higher unsubsidized loan limits than adependent student.
- ✦The parent of an independent student cannot borrow a
- Direct PLUS Loan for the student.
- Financial Need
- A borrower applying for Title IV aid who has a defaulted federal student
- To apply for a Direct PLUS Loan, a parent fills out an application/
- ✦Only one parent needs to sign the Direct PLUS Loan
- application/promissory note.
- ✦A parent does not have to fill out the Free Application for Federal
- Student Aid (FAFSA) to receive a Direct PLUS Loan.
- Checking Credit History
- Because Direct PLUS Loans are not available to parents with an adversecredit history, an applicants credit history is checked. Laws & Regulations
- 5-8 Direct Loan School GuideChapter 5
- September 1999The U.S. Department of Educations (EDs) Loan Origination Center
- (LOC) checks credit history with a national credit bureau each time aparent applies for a Direct PLUS Loan.
- ✦A parent who doesnt have a credit history is not considered to
- have an adverse credit history.
- ✦A parent has an adverse credit history if the credit report shows
- example credit cards or loans) or
- ✧within five years of the date of the credit report,
- write-off of a federal education debt.
- Within five business days of receiving a Direct PLUS Loan application, the
- Loan Origination Center (LOC) notifies the school of the applicants creditevaluation.  This is done through decision codes on the Direct PLUS Loanorigination record.  The LOC also notifies the parent of the results of thecredit check.
- The school then continues processing loans for applicants who meet the
- credit criteria and stops processing loans for applicants who do not meetthe criteria.
- Effect of Adverse Credit History on the Parent
- When a parent doesnt pass the credit check, the LOC sends a letternotifying the parent that he or she is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loanbecause of adverse credit history.  The letter tells the parent which nationalTake a Look
- about school policies forcanceling or bypassingDirect PLUS Loanapplications for parents withadverse credit.
- ✦The parent can opt to take no further application actions (in other
- words, stop the Direct PLUS Loan application process).
- ✦If the parent believes the credit bureau provided inaccurate credit
- information, he or she can contact the reporting credit bureau toresolve the issue.
- ✦If the parent believes the adverse credit history is correct but that
- there are extenuating circumstances, he or she may appeal to theLOC and document the extenuating circumstance(s).
- adverse credit history and submit a revised Direct PLUS Loanapplication/promissory note.  The endorser (who cannot be thedependent student for whom the parent is trying to borrow) mustagree to repay the loan if the parent doesnt.  (An endorser form isincluded in the rejection letter.)
- The letter the LOC sends encourages the parent to tell the financial aid
- administrator at the students school which of the outlined options theparent plans to take.  The reason:  If the parent decides not to pursue aDirect PLUS Loan further, the student becomes eligible for an additionalDirect Unsubsidized Loan amount.  The sooner the school knows theparent is stopping the loan-application process, the sooner it can beginhelping the student get additional loan funds.
- Only one parent needs to apply for a Direct PLUS Loan.  If one parent is
- turned down because of adverse credit, the other parent does not need toapply before the student is eligible for an additional loan amount.
- Effect of Parent’s Adverse Credit History on the Student
- If a parent is not eligible for a Direct PLUS Loan because of adverse credithistory, the dependent student for whom the parent wished to borrow isallowed to borrow additional money from the Direct Loan Program.  Thestudent becomes eligible for an additional Direct Unsubsidized Loanamount, up to the loan limits for an independent student.  Where to Call

- 5-10 Direct Loan School GuideChapter 5
- September 1999School Policy Options for Handling Parents with Adverse
- Credit Histories
- When a parent applicant doesnt meet Direct PLUS Loan credit criteria, aschool must stop all loan processing on the application.
- Because of the various appeal options a rejected parent applicant has, the
- school might want to establish a policy defining how long it will wait forthe results of a parents appeal(s) before it begins processing an additionalDirect Unsubsidized Loan for the dependent student.
- An effective school policy would have procedures for:
- credit bureau records, appealing on the basis of extenuatingcircumstances, seeking an endorser, or no longer wishes to pursuea Direct PLUS Loan;
- not eligible to borrow a Direct PLUS Loan because of an adversecredit history, then the student is eligible to borrow additionalfunds in a Direct Unsubsidized Loan;
- ✦creating a process for officially adjusting a Direct PLUS Loan
- application (if the parent decides not to pursue the loan) so that theschool can begin processing a Direct Unsubsidized Loan for thestudent; and
- borrow a Direct PLUS Loan due to exceptional circumstances, and
- the students family is otherwise unable to provide the studentsExpected Family Contribution (EFC).
- to meet the credit criteria (for example, show documentationof a tax lien), the parent does not need to go through theprocess of applyingand being rejectedfor a Direct PLUSLoan.
- ✧Instead, a school can develop an internal process to bypass the
- application process and award additional Direct UnsubsidizedLoan funding to the dependent student.

- In addition to the three national credit bureaus, there are credit-scoring companies. Fair, Isaac
- makes the FICO score, which is by far the most widely tested and used by creditors. You can
- purchase your score or learn more with scoring simulators at www.myfico.com . Scores can range
- from 300 to 850. The higher the score, the bett er the credit rating. Gene rally, any score above
- 700 indicates a good credit risk, and below 650 is a problem. Remember, you can work to
- improve your score, no matter how low it is right now.
- Reasons Your Score May Be Lowered
-  Time since delinquency paid up is too short;
-  Proportion of balances to credit li mits is too high (maxed-out);
-  Too many accounts from sub-prime le nders (like finance companies);
-  Length of positive credit history is too short, or no recent balances.
- FICO Has Disclosed the General Structure of How Their Model Scores
- 35% = payment history (have you paid on ti me, especially over past two years)
- 30% = amounts owed (how much  owed total, and how much in relation to credit limits)
- 15% = length of credit history (how l ong you’ve had accounts, how long since used)
- 10% = new credit (how many new accounts and how many new inquiries)
- 10% = types of credit used (h ealthy mix of loans, bankcards , store cards, no sub-prime)
- Things You Can Do to Build Good  Credit to Boost Your Score
-  Check your credit report and write the bureaus to remove any errors.
-  Avoid lots of inquiries. If you are turned down for credit, fix the problem before applying

- consumers turn to payday loans to deal with em ergencies (ex: car repair , funeral costs) since

- Local payday lenders typically re quire consumers to secure the loan with a post-dated check.
- Loan amounts vary but $500 is typical, and most  common interest rate is $25 on every $100 lent
- – which is equivalent to a 650% APR if it is a two-week loan. Due to the high fees and short

Financial Tips:
- Financial Tips
- Education and Outreach
- to make smart financial decisions, so consumers can operate
- safely in the financial marketplace.
- “Financial knowledge
- Set Financial Goals
- Make it a regular habit to set financial
- Not all debts are created equal.  Some debt, such as home loans or student loans, may offer tax write-offs and enable women to achieve greater wealth or earning power.  Other debt, such as credit card debts, offers no such benefits.  If you have credit card debt, try to pay the entire balance every month.  Or pay more than the minimum monthly payment.  Either way, you will reduce your interest costs. If you are experiencing financial difficulty, contact creditors before payments are due.  Ask creditors to waive fees, reduce the interest rate, or work with you to create a payment schedule that will work with your budget.
- Saving
- spenders, not savers.  But saving should
- future. Everyone needs a nest egg or rainy day fund. It’s easiest to start small—regularly deposit even a modest amount into an interest-bearing savings account. Soon you’ll have a special savings fund that can help you handle unanticipated expenses.
- Manage Your Own Finances
- In the past, many women were less experienced at managing finances than men. Even today, some women depend on their partner/spouse’s income and financial expertise. If something happens, such as job loss, separation, divorce, or the death of a spouse, women may be left with few financial resources and a mountain of debt. That’s why it’s important to learn how to manage your own finances and increase your financial literacy. A good way to do this is to establish and manage your own checking, savings and retirement accounts.
- The sooner you start planning for retirement, the better. Don’t put off saving for retirement or leave it up to someone else to make those decisions. This is especially important for women, since women tend to live longer and earn less than men, and often have career gaps due to family responsibilities. As a result, women often receive lower pensions and have fewer assets in retirement. If you already have a retirement plan, increase your contributions or open a second account if at all possible. If you haven’t started, attend retirement workshops hosted by your employer, or non-profits, government agencies, community centers, or other non-commercial entities to learn more about your options. Review your Social Security benefits and use the on-line retirement calculator: www.ssa.gov
- If a financial opportunity sounds too
- believe promises of quick profits or “insider” information, and don’t fall for urgent warnings that  “you must act now. ” Always verify that paperwork matches promises, and never sign a blank form. Be sure to ask how a financial services professional receives compensation. For example, do they receive an up-front fee, or do they earn commissions or bonuses based on the the cost or amount of products they sell?  Unethical salespeople may try to switch interest rates, terms and conditions, or change other important financial details. And remember it’s a bad sign if a salesperson won’t allow you time to compare prices and features or explore other options. These tactics are warning signs of fraud.  Consider diversifying the types of accounts you use for your investments as well as the institutions that hold your money.  Also, review your telephone bills, credit card bills, cell phone bills and other accounts to be sure you’re not being charged for a product or service you didn’t order or don’t need.
- Request and review your credit
- report at least once every year, and look for accounts you don’t recognize (especially new accounts), suspicious charges, or any addresses where you’ve never lived. To get your free credit report, go to www.annualcreditreport.com   Make it a practice to regularly review your bills, financial statements, files and records. Shred (don’t toss) cancelled checks, credit card statements, old bills and other financial papers you no longer need. When creating passwords, don’t use your mother’s maiden name, pet or children’s names, birth or anniversary dates, phone numbers, consecutive numbers, or the last four digits of your Social Security number.

- offers fail to provide students and families with the consumer information they need,
- including the cost of the institution and clarity about the types of aid being provided
- to the student.34 If critical information provided about the cost of attendance and aid
- available is not clear, students and families are not able to make optimized choices
- about colleges and compare their value propositions. A choice made based on incom -

- Institutions of higher education should adopt the following best practices to ensure
- that their financial aid offer letters are clear, timely, and customized, and provide stu -
- education institutions should consider developing and testing additional interven -
- tions to improve students’ comprehension of their options for paying for college and
- the financial aid offer.
- • Present an itemized and sub-totaled cost of attendance. Students need to know
- what specific costs are, who they are paid to, and when they need to be paid. Cost of
- books, supplies, and other necessary costs,41 is essential to list on all aid offers. COA is
- best presented broken down by direct costs (what will need to be paid to the college)
- itemized list of specific components as well as a sub-total. Relevant assumptions used
- the student (in-state or out-of-state) and attendance (full or part-time).
- • Differentiate aid offers by type. Many students are new to borrowing and higher
- education financing options. Therefore, institutions should not assume that
- Section 2: Best Practices for Delivery of Financial Literacy at Institutions of Higher Education 15students know the difference among grants, loans, and work-study. The word “loan”
- should always be included when referencing a loan. Differentiating aid offers by
- easy way institutions can teach students financial literacy basics. Recommended
- category headings and descriptors include: (1) Grants and/or Scholarships (aid
- that does not need to be repaid); (2) Student Loans (borrowed money to be paid
- back with interest); and (3) Work-Study Employment (aid earned through a job).
- Furthermore, it is a best practice to clearly state the source of each aid type listed
- • Highlight critical details and distinctions by aid type. Institutions can further
- educate students by providing the most relevant distinctions and/or requirements
- for each aid type. A brief, yet additional, layer of detail helps students assess which
- aid options are the best financial option for them and assists them to plan how to
- access and/or maintain that aid type. For example, for Grants and/or Scholarships,
- as minimum credits and/or grades) and informing students how to maintain their
- aid. For work-study employment, describing that a campus-approved job must be
- first secured and then aid is disbursed as earned from a paycheck provides students
- key information for how to budget this amount accurately.
- • Calculate the cost after grants and scholarships are applied. Students and families
- read financial aid offers in order to determine the actual cost of attending the
- institution. The offer should show the costs the individual student would need to
- pay the institution directly and/or what the net cost will be to cover all relevant
- expenses. If the costs could change from the time of the aid offer to the time of
- depend on individual student decisions, the letter should clearly state that the
- estimate is based on averages and actual cost will depend upon student choices.
- • Do not include Parent PLUS loans as part of the student’s loan package (if
- applicable) . Parent PLUS loans are made to the parent and not the student, and
- should be listed separately if at all. These loans require an additional application
- and approval process, include a higher origination fee, charge higher interest rates,
- and offer fewer repayment options.43 Since Parent PLUS loans are significantly
- different from student loans and carry greater risk, institutions of higher education
- should clearly disclose how they differ from student loans, and clearly differentiate
- them from the student’s aid, if they are included.
- • Provide actionable next steps. Financial aid offers should help students understand

URL: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/open-government/information-quality-guidelines


Application Process:
- The Bureau strives to ensure and maximize the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of the information that it disseminates to the public. The Bureau strives to incorporate information quality criteria into its information dissemination practices, and ensures the quality of information the agency disseminates in accordance with the standards set forth in these Guidelines. The Bureau is committed to integrating the principle of information quality into its development of information, including the creation, collection, maintenance, and dissemination of such information. The Bureau will comply with all legal and policy rules, regulations, directives, and guidance governing any phase of the process. High quality information represents a performance goal for organizational components of the Bureau who are charged with disseminating information.
- To ensure and maximize quality information, the standards should focus on the three underlying requirements for quality: utility, objectivity, and integrity of information.
- Objectivity: The Bureau will consider whether disseminated information is accurate, clear, complete, and unbiased both in presentation and substance. Information will be presented within its proper context. Where appropriate, data will be accompanied by full, accurate, and transparent documentation, and will disclose error sources affecting its quality. Analytic results will be generated using sound statistical and research methods.
- Integrity: The Bureau will protect information from unauthorized access or revision, to prevent corruption or falsification of information. The Bureau will comply with government-wide security requirements when disseminating information.
- When used regarding financial or statistical information, a characterization of “influential” generally means the Bureau determines that dissemination of the information will have or does have a clear and substantial impact on important public policies or important private sector decisions. Organizational components of the Bureau shall develop appropriate definitions of what constitutes “influential” information as they develop processes for dissemination. When information is determined by an organization component to be “influential,” an added level of scrutiny will be applied, including an assurance that the information is reproducible.
- The Bureau has drafted the following guidelines to promulgate its quality standards and formalize its correction mechanism. The policies and procedures strive to ensure that the quality of information and data released to the public is accurate and appropriate and meets the Bureau’s internal definitions of utility, objectivity, and integrity.
- This guidance should be used to ensure and maximize the quality of information disseminated by the Bureau. The Bureau’s guidelines are based on the OMB guidelines. The guidelines are not intended to be legally binding regulations or mandates. They are not legally enforceable and do not create any legal rights or impose any legally binding requirements or obligations on the Bureau or the public. Nothing in these guidelines affects any otherwise available judicial review of agency action.
- The Bureau guidelines are effective upon publication. The guidelines cover information disseminated on or after publication of the guidelines, regardless of when the information was first disseminated.
- Organizational components should use these guidelines to develop processes for disseminating quality information. The guidelines apply to information disseminated to the public in any medium, including textual, graphic, narrative, numerical, or audiovisual forms. The guidelines apply to information that the Bureau posts on the internet. The guidelines also apply to Bureau-sponsored distribution of information – that is, any information distributed by a third party at the direction of the Bureau or information the Bureau has the authority to review and approve prior to release. The guidelines do not extend to Bureau interpretations of data and information.
- The guidelines do not override other compelling interests such as privacy, trade secrets, intellectual property, and other confidentiality protections. The guidelines do not apply to hyperlinks to information disseminated by others. The guidelines do not apply to opinions where the Bureau’s presentation makes it clear that the material is an opinion or the Bureau’s views rather than fact. In addition, the guidelines do not apply to information disseminated in the following contexts:
- Correspondence with individual persons, archival records, public filings, subpoenas or adjudicative processes;
- Process
- Information quality is integral to every step of the development of information, from its creation through its collection, maintenance, and dissemination. Organizational components of Bureau are expected to develop processes for reviewing the quality, including the objectivity, utility, and integrity, of information before it is disseminated. The processes should substantiate the quality of the information disseminated through documentation or other means appropriate to the information.
- The Bureau will disseminate information that meets high standards as confirmed by stringent internal review and approval processes. The Bureau will produce information products that are presented in an unbiased, clear, complete, and well-documented manner. It will utilize highly reliable review sources for corroboration of information, and will seek public comment as appropriate. Specialized surveys and peer reviews will utilize methodologies that are consistent with generally accepted industry standards for all aspects of survey design and implementation. The Bureau will make both original and supporting data and the source of the data available to the public when appropriate. The Bureau will utilize transparent methods consistent with its obligation to protect proprietary or confidential information. The Bureau will subject all information to editing and review.
- Bureau adheres to OMB’s Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) clearance process to improve the quality of information that the Bureau collects and disseminates to the public. The PRA requires the Bureau to demonstrate the “practical utility” of a proposed collection of information that Bureau plans to disseminate. Bureau will also demonstrate in PRA clearance submissions to OMB that the proposed collection of information will result in information that will be collected, maintained, and used in a way consistent with the OMB and Bureau information quality guidelines.
- Any individual who believes that information disseminated by the Bureau does not comply with OMB or Bureau guidelines may seek correction of the information by filing a “Section 515 Complaint” with the Bureau. The process for filing a complaint is intended to be flexible, appropriate to the nature and timeliness of the disseminated information, and incorporated into the Bureaus’ information resources management and administrative practices.
- Complaint process. A complaint may be submitted by mail, personal delivery, electronic mail, or fax using the following contact information:
- Privacy policy: The Bureau is authorized to collect the information provided under Section 515, 44 U.S.C. § 3516. The information is necessary to process any request for correction of information disseminated by Bureau. An individual is not required to furnish the information, but failure to do so may prevent the request for correction from being processed. The information provided will rarely be used for any purpose other than to process and respond to a request; however, the Bureau may disclose information to other federal entities such as Congress or the Department of Justice if required to do so by federal law.
- The individual filing the complaint has the responsibility to clearly present the basis for the section 515 complaint. The Bureau may determine that the complaint does not meet the threshold requirements for processing, either because required elements are not addressed or because the allegations are too vague for the Bureau to take action. The burden of proof falls on the individual filing the complaint to show both that he or she is an affected party and that the information needs to be changed. An individual whose complaint is rejected may file an appeal in accordance with the procedures set forth below.
- The correction and appeal process set forth in these guidelines does not apply upon first publication to information disseminated by the Bureau through a comprehensive public comment process – e.g., Federal Register notices of proposed rulemakings, regulatory analyses, and requests for comments on information collections subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act. In most cases, comments concerning the quality of the disseminated information can be addressed through these procedures, such as by responding to a request for correction of the information in the preamble to a final rule. In unusual circumstances, the Bureau may determine that earlier consideration of such comments in accordance with these guidelines would be appropriate. For example, the procedures set forth in these guidelines should be used if the commenter has shown a reasonable likelihood of suffering actual harm if the comment is not resolved before issuance of the final action and the Bureau determines that resolving the matter pursuant to these guidelines will not unduly delay the final action.
- Provide management and oversight to the Bureau-wide implementation of the guidelines
- Develop and issue final Bureau information quality guidelines and post them on the Bureau website
- Report to the Director of OMB on the number of and nature of complaints regarding compliance with the guidelines for the quality of disseminated information and how such complaints were resolved
- Designate a point of contact for compliance with the information quality processes within their organization
- Develop, if necessary, information quality standards for ensuring and maximizing quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information, including statistical information, consistent with these guidelines
- Reporting requirements
- Bureau will consider public comments received in response to publication of these draft guidelines, and submit revised guidelines to OMB for review. Bureau will post notice of the availability of final guidelines in the Federal Register and post the final guidelines approved by OMB on its website. Bureau will provide annual reports to OMB indicating the number and nature of complaints received concerning agency compliance and how such complaints were resolved.

Eligibility Criteria:
- One note: The Roth IRA has income limits for eligibility; those who earn too much can't contribute.
- Contribution limit: For 2025, the 401(k) contribution is $70,000 or 100% of earned income, whichever is less (this is up from the 2024 401(k) contribution limit of $69,000). Those over age 50 can add an extra $7,500 as a catch-up contribution, but individuals between ages 60 to 63 are eligible to add a larger contribution of $11,250 due to Secure Act 2.0 [0]Internal Revenue Service. 2025 Amounts Relating to Retirement Plans and IRAs, as Adjusted for Changes in Cost-of-Living.View all sources.
- In your capacity as the employer, you can make an additional contribution of up to 25% of compensation. Employer contributions must be made by the tax filing deadline, or extension date if applicable. There is a special rule for sole proprietors and single-member LLCs: You can contribute 25% of net self-employment income, which is your net profit less half your self-employment tax and the plan contributions you made for yourself. The limit on compensation that can be used to factor your contribution is $350,000 in 2025.
- In your capacity as the employer, you can make an additional contribution of up to 25% of compensation. Employer contributions must be made by the tax filing deadline, or extension date if applicable. There is a special rule for sole proprietors and single-member LLCs: You can contribute 25% of net self-employment income, which is your net profit less half your self-employment tax and the plan contributions you made for yourself. The limit on compensation that can be used to factor your contribution is $350,000 in 2025.
- Keep in mind that the contribution limits apply per person, not per plan. So, if you also have outside employment that offers a 401(k) or your spouse does, the contribution limits cover both plans.
- One other thing to know: You can also choose a solo Roth 401(k), which mimics the tax treatment of a Roth IRA. Again, you might go with this option if your income and tax rate are lower now than you expect them to be in retirement.
- Contribution limit: The lesser of $69,000 in 2024, or up to 25% of compensation or net self-employment earnings, with a $345,000 limit on compensation that can be used to factor the contribution. In 2025, that limit rises to $70,000, with a $350,000 limit on compensation. Again, net self-employment income is net profit minus half of your self-employment taxes paid and your SEP contribution. No catch-up contribution. Be sure to make your contributions by the federal income tax filing deadline, usually mid-April, or the extension deadline if filing for an extension.
- Tax advantage: For traditional SEP IRA contributions, you can deduct the lesser of your contributions or 25% of net self-employment earnings or compensation — limited to that $345,000 cap per employee in 2024, or $350,000 in 2025 — on your tax return. Distributions in retirement are taxed as income.

Application Process:
- Get started: The process is similar to a SEP IRA — you can open a SIMPLE at an online broker, with a heavier paperwork load than your standard IRA.
- The traditional SIMPLE IRA is also inflexible, particularly early on: Early withdrawals before age 59½ are treated the same as early 401(k) or IRA distributions in that they are taxed as income and subject to a 10% penalty. But if you make a withdrawal within the first two years of participation in a SIMPLE IRA, the 10% penalty is increased to 25%. That means you also can’t roll over a SIMPLE to another retirement account within that two-year period.
- One other thing to know: There is a 401(k) version of a SIMPLE, which works in much the same way but allows participants to take loans from their accounts. This version requires more administrative oversight and can be more expensive to set up.
- Best for: A self-employed person with no employees who has a high income and wants to save a lot for retirement on an ongoing basis.
- Tax advantage: Contributions are generally tax deductible, and distributions in retirement are taxed as income. An actuary must figure your deduction limit, which adds an administrative layer.
- People often lament the decline of pension plans, and this is exactly that: If you’re self-employed, you can set up your own pension — a guaranteed stream of income — in retirement by using a defined benefit plan.
- The upsides are that you can stash a lot of cash in these, and you can defer taxes until retirement. If you’re fairly close to retirement, earning an income that you know you’ll maintain, and can afford to save $50,000 to $80,000 or more per year, you might consider using this plan to supercharge your savings efforts.
- Each broker will walk you through the process of opening one of these accounts and explain any paperwork you may need to file with the IRS. But to be on the safe side, you may also want to work with an accountant.

- For most people, attaining financial health is a journey — one that lasts a lifetime. Very few people are lucky enough to have instant security from generational wealth or a massive lottery jackpot. Instead, the progression tends to look like this:
- Building foundations. This can describe when you're getting started in the workplace, but it might apply later, too, because life doesn't always go to plan. Strengthening foundations includes creating an emergency fund, building your credit score and balancing expenses and debt load. And it's never too early — or late — to start planning for retirement, so that your savings have time to take advantage of the magic of compound interest.
- Stacking up wins. As you gain momentum, continue to grow your financial stability. This could mean things like paying down debt balances, using insurance coverage to protect your assets and knowing what your needs will be in retirement. Staying on top of managing your credit score will help push it higher, which gives you more financial choice.
- Doing great. You're on top of your savings plan and have a healthy debt-to-income ratio. A longer track record of managing your credit score helps, too; credit scores tend to peak in later work decades. Having a handle on financial planning and a solid approach to insurance positions you to build and protect your assets.

Application Process:
- The first step in choosing an airline credit card is determining whether an airline card even makes sense for you, especially compared with a general travel credit card whose rewards aren't tied to a specific carrier. An airline card can be a good choice if you regularly fly the same airline and do so often enough that the benefits you get from the card justify the annual fee.
- The more you fly a particular airline, the more able you are to rack up enough miles for a free flight or seat upgrade and use those rewards for a flight you want. Checked bags are a big consideration because most major airline cards include a checked bag fee waiver, which can be valuable and quickly make up for the annual fee.
- If you fly mostly one airline, choose a card from that carrier. If you regularly fly a couple of airlines, you might even consider getting cards for both. In choosing among a major airline’s credit cards, a primary differentiator is airport lounge access. If you think lounge access is worth it, get the premium card but be prepared to absorb a hefty annual fee. Beware that a lower-tier, no-annual-fee airline card might not include free checked bags.

Just make sure you fly that airline often enough to use the benefits.

And longer-term, general travel credit cards are far more valuable and flexible — because their rewards are more valuable and flexible.

- The three biggest domestic airlines all offer credit cards with no annual fee:
- If you fly a single airline a couple of times a year and you regularly check bags, you'll easily save more money with an annual-fee card than with a no-annual-fee option. But if you're dead-set against paying annual fees in any case, consider skipping an airline card entirely. Consider a no-annual-fee general-purpose travel credit card whose rewards can be used on any airline (or any other travel expense), or get a good cash-back credit card and save your cash rewards for your next trip.

- The Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card pays bonus rewards not only on Delta flights but also at restaurants worldwide and at U.S. supermarkets, making it the rare airline card that's great for everyday spending. A best-in-class checked-bag benefit (first bag free for you and up to eight others on your reservation), priority boarding and the opportunity to earn a flight credit each year make this card a bargain for Delta stalwarts. Read our review.
- Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card
- Southwest Airlines' priciest card is also its best. The Southwest Rapid Rewards® Priority Credit Card doesn't offer richer rewards or a significantly better sign-up bonus than the carrier's lower-fee cards, but it comes with an annual travel credit, a great anniversary bonus and other perks that justify (and offset) its annual fee. Read our review.
- Alaska Airlines Visa Signature® credit card
- If you're a committed Alaska Airlines flyer, or you travel enough on the West Coast that you could become one, the Alaska Airlines Visa Signature® credit card is very nearly a must-have. The annual Companion Fare benefit alone can more than make up for the reasonable annual fee. Read our review.
- For occasional but loyal American Airlines flyers, the no-annual-fee American Airlines AAdvantage® MileUp® is a cost-effective way to earn not only miles but also credit toward elite frequent-flyer status. Read our review.
- Every airline has a premium card that gets you into its airport lounges, but the Delta SkyMiles® Reserve American Express Card also gets you into American Express's Centurion Lounges when flying Delta, and it comes with an annual companion certificate that's good even in first class. Terms apply. Read our review.
- Aeroplan® Credit Card
- Terrific rewards rates, generous bonus opportunities, a leg up on elite status and a raft of other perks make the Aeroplan® Credit Card worth a look for those who travel regularly in Canada and/or on the Star Alliance network. Read our review.
- If your business has you on the road a lot, you'll appreciate the airport lounge access on the Delta SkyMiles® Reserve Business American Express Card. The annual companion certificate — which is good even in first class — and the checked-bag benefit add considerable value, too. Terms apply. Learn more and apply.
- Airline credit cards earn frequent-flyer program miles every time you use the card, but the value of these miles depends both on the airline and how you redeem the miles.
- How to choose an airline credit card
- Travel enthusiasts have multiple options besides airline cards, notably general travel credit cards. These cards provide travel rewards without tying you to a single airline. Their rewards usually apply to a wide range of travel-related expenses. And general travel cards tend to be simpler than airline-specific credit cards. So if you spread your flying among several airlines or don’t fly that much, a general travel card may be a better choice than an airline card.
- You might not need a travel card at all, if a different kind of rewards credit card is a better fit. Indeed, a 2016 NerdWallet study found that most people — including many travelers — would get more in rewards with a cash-back card than with any travel credit card.
- Finally, if you fly different airlines but prefer a particular hotel chain — or if you would just prefer free nights to free flights — consider getting a hotel credit card.
- NerdWallet's Credit Cards team selects the best airline credit cards based on overall consumer value, as evidenced by star ratings, as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers and for flyers loyal to a specific airline. Factors in our evaluation include each card's annual fee, rewards earning rates, redemption options, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy perks such as free checked bags, priority boarding, free or discounted companion fares, in-flight privileges or discounts, and airport lounge access. Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards.
- How do airline credit cards work?
- Every time you use an airline-branded credit card to make a purchase, you earn rewards points, usually called "miles." Those miles get deposited into your account with the airline's loyalty program, where you can use them to book free flights. Many airline credit cards also come with perks, such as free checked bags, priority boarding, discounts on in-flight purchases or access to the airline's airport lounges.
- With most cash-back cards, you can see your accumulated earnings on your monthly statement or through your online account portal, and you can decide when and how to redeem your cash back. Some cards automatically apply your cash back to your account as a credit.
- How many miles do I earn with an airline credit card?
- In most cases, there's no limit to the number of miles you can earn with an airline credit card. The more you spend, the more you earn:
- Additionally, most airline credit cards offer new cardholders a bonus as an incentive to use the card. Spend a certain amount of money — say, $2,000 — within the first few months, and you'll get tens of thousands of miles dropped into your account.
- The miles you earn with an airline credit card come on top of the miles you earn from actually flying on the airline.
- Most frequent flyer programs nowadays earn miles based on how much you pay for a ticket rather than how far you've flown. (The term "miles" is a holdover from the days when the miles you earned were literally based on the miles you flew.) For example, an airline might give basic members of their loyalty program 5 miles per dollar spent on a ticket. Buy a $1,000 ticket, and you earn 5,000 miles. You could get an additional 2 miles per dollar spent by buying the ticket with the airline's credit card. That would bump your total rewards for the flight to 7,000 miles.
- Can I earn elite status with an airline credit card?
- Elite status in a frequent-flyer program entitles you to perks not typically available to casual travelers, such as free seat upgrades, priority boarding, higher rewards rates, fee waivers and other benefits. Airlines reserve this status for their best customers, so elite qualifying is mostly tied to how much business you actually do with the airline — how much money you spend on tickets and how many flights you take. Miles earned from spending on a credit card generally don't count toward elite status.
- That said, some airline credit cards offer a boost toward elite status as an added incentive to use their cards. Take the Southwest Rapid Rewards® Premier Credit Card. One way to gain Southwest's elite "A-List" status is to earn 35,000 "tier qualifying points" in a year. In general, you get qualifying points by buying tickets from Southwest; points earned from spending on the credit card don't count. However, for every $10,000 you spend on the card, the issuer throws in a bonus of 1,500 tier qualifying points (up to 15,000 a year).
- Also, keep in mind that airline credit cards offer some of the perks of elite status, such as free checked bags and preferred boarding.
- Do airline credit cards get you free checked bags or airport lounge access?
- Many airline credit cards let you check a bag for free, which can save you about $30 on each flight you take. A couple round trips a year, and the money you save in bag fees can be enough to pay for a card with a $95 annual fee. In most cases:
- • Some fine print applies. For example, you might not get a free bag if you don't book directly with the airline, or if you fail to provide a frequent-flyer number. See our tips to avoid bag-fee gotchas.
- • Airline credit cards with no annual fee generally do not offer free checked bags.
- American, Delta and United airlines each offer a premium credit card that gives you access the the carrier's airport lounges. Annual fees on "club" cards usually run several hundred dollars a year. Some less-expensive cards might offer limited access, such as a couple of one-time passes or the ability to buy a lounge pass at a discount.

Application Process:
- There are so many options among rewards credit cards that picking the right one for you can be daunting. Make the process easier by approaching it systematically.
- The first step is determining whether a rewards card is right for you at all. The best rewards credit cards require good to excellent credit — generally defined as a credit score of 690 or above — although there are a handful of options for fair or even bad credit.
- A rewards card makes sense if you pay your bill in full every month. If you carry a balance from month to month, the interest you'll pay can quickly wipe out the value of your rewards; you'd be better off with a low-interest credit card, or a balance-transfer credit card that would allow you to pay down your debt over a defined period of time with 0% interest.
- You'll want a rewards credit card that makes sense on both the "earn" side and the "burn" side. That means a card that rewards you for the kind of spending you do (earn) and that gives you rewards you can use (burn). For example, earning 5% cash back on home improvement stores might not do much for someone who lives in a small studio apartment. And if you never travel, airline miles are pretty much worthless.
- Because of those factors, there’s no single “best” rewards card for everybody. Best might be a simple, flat-rate cash-back card, a premium travel card laden with benefits, or something in between. If you’re having trouble deciding on a type of rewards card, give special consideration to cash back. A NerdWallet study has shown cash-back credit cards are better for most people than travel cards.
- » MORE: Our guide to choosing a rewards credit card.
- We've discussed how to evaluate a credit card's rewards structure. But rewards rates aren't the only factor to consider when choosing a rewards credit card.
- The credit cards with the richest rewards often charge annual fees. This is especially the case with travel credit cards. Typical annual fees range from around $90 to more than $500. Although some people are dead-set against paying them, annual fees can be worth it (or even a bargain) if the rewards and perks you earn outweigh the cost, and some cards waive the annual fee for the first year.

- Rewards are what you get for using a credit card. Perks are what you get simply for carrying the card — and depending on the card, perks can deliver even more value than rewards. Travel cards, in particular, are known for their perks. Examples include:
- Automatic credit for travel expenses. Several general travel cards will reimburse hundreds of dollars a year in travel expenses. This might apply to any travel purchase, or to specific expenses such as airline fees or Uber rides. Learn more about travel credits.

- Airport lounge access. The biggest airlines (American, Delta, United) all offer high-end, high-annual-fee credit cards that get you into their airport lounges when you travel, and some lower-fee airline cards offer discounted or limited access. Several general travel cards get you into lounges in worldwide networks such as Priority Pass. American Express even has its own lounge network. Learn more about cards with lounge access.

- Free nights and other amenities. Credit cards issued by hotel chains offer perks that general travel cards can't match. Some of them give you one free night a year, which can make up the cost of the card immediately. Other benefits include free breakfast, free internet and early check-in or late check-out.

- They allow you to travel more often, or more luxuriously, at a discount. Travel rewards credit cards can make it possible to sit in first class, upgrade to a suite or skip the long security line. Even if you don’t cash in points to travel like an Instagram influencer, they can help you travel for less money.

Even if you don’t cash in points to travel like an Instagram influencer, they can help you travel for less money.
- Rewards cards typically have higher APRs. That means credit card debt will cost you more over time. For a major purchase you’d like to pay back over time, look into a card with a 0% introductory APR offer. In general, use a rewards card only for purchases you’ll be able to pay in full when your statement comes.

Financial Tips:
- Annual fees add up, especially if you carry multiple rewards cards.
- Annual fees add up, especially if you carry multiple rewards cards.
- Put all your ordinary expenses on the card, including monthly bills, to rack up rewards more quickly. That’s the power of a rewards card: getting extra value from your regular spending. Before applying for a card, make sure you’ll be able to meet the spending minimum required to earn the sign-up bonus. Be careful to never overspend just for rewards.
- Redeem your rewards in the way that delivers maximum value. With travel cards, you usually get a better redemption rate when you redeem for travel expenses than you would if you opted for cash back. Cash-back cards, meanwhile, may give you the highest redemption rate for statement credit, but a lower rate if you redeem points for gift cards. Some rewards can be transferred to travel partners, such as airlines and hotels, at a valuable rate. Learn what the options are and what your rewards are worth.

Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards.
- How do rewards credit cards work?
- There are two main types of rewards credit cards: cash-back cards and points/miles cards:
- • With a cash-back credit card, the card issuer "pays you back" a certain percentage of every purchase. For example, if your card earns 1.5% cash back on all purchases and you buy something for $100, you would earn $1.50 in cash back.
- • With a points or miles card, the issuer gives you a certain number of rewards points (often called “miles” on airline and travel credit cards) for each dollar you spend. How you use the points or miles depends on the card. Common redemption options include travel, gift cards and merchandise.
- What can I do with credit card rewards?
- What you can do with your credit card rewards depends on the type of rewards you’ve earned and the card’s rules:
- • Cash-back rewards are typically redeemable for a credit on your statement, which reduces your outstanding balance. You may also be able to have your rewards deposited into a bank account or sent as a check.
- • Points or miles are most commonly redeemed for travel, but you may also be able to redeem them for gift cards, merchandise or cash back. For cards that carry the name of an airline or hotel brand, you typically use your rewards for free travel or upgrades. Some bank-branded credit cards let you transfer their points into airline or hotel programs.
- How many credit card rewards points can I earn?
- In most cases, there is no limit to how many points or miles or how much cash back you can earn with a credit card. Some cards do limit how much spending is eligible for bonus rewards — that is, higher rewards offered in specific categories — but after you hit that limit, you still earn rewards at the base rate. For example, a card might offer 3% rewards on up to $6,000 a year in spending and then 1% after that.
- How much are credit card rewards points worth?
- What credit score do I need to get a rewards credit card?
- The best rewards credit cards typically require good to excellent credit for approval. Good credit is generally defined as a credit score of 690 or better. However, there are some decent rewards-bearing cards for people with fair credit and even bad credit. Keep in mind that credit scores are only one factor in your application. Every issuer has its own criteria for approval.
- Are credit card rewards taxable?
- Typically, credit card rewards are not taxable. That's because the IRS generally considers credit card rewards to be discounts or rebates on purchases made with the card, not income.
- Do credit card rewards expire?
- Whether your credit card rewards expire depends on the card and the rewards program. In most cases, rewards do not expire as long as your account is active — meaning, you are using the card for purchases at least occasionally. Some programs require you to redeem your rewards within a certain time frame, but that's becoming more and more rare.
- Is there a limit to the amount of rewards you can earn with a rewards credit card?
- There is usually no limit to the rewards you can earn with a credit card. Some cards do limit how much spending is eligible for "bonus" rewards — that is, higher rewards for certain purchases — but after you hit that limit, you still earn rewards at the base rate. For example, a card might offer 2 points per dollar on up to $10,000 a year in spending and then 1 point per dollar after that. Or a card will offer 3% on groceries on up to $6,000 a year in spending, then 1% after that.
- How do you redeem credit card rewards?
- Cash back can almost always be redeemed for a credit on your statement. So, for example, if your account has a balance of $200 and you redeem $30 in cash back, your balance would drop to $170. You may also be able to redeem cash back as a deposit into a bank account or even as a check mailed to you, but these options aren't always available. Some cards have a minimum redemption amount, like $20 or $25.
- Cash back can almost always be redeemed for a credit on your statement. So, for example, if your account has a balance of $200 and you redeem $30 in cash back, your balance would drop to $170. You may also be able to redeem cash back as a deposit into a bank account or even as a check mailed to you, but these options aren't always available. Some cards have a minimum redemption amount, like $20 or $25.
- General-purpose credit card points — such as Chase Ultimate Rewards®, American Express Membership Rewards, Citi ThankYou Points, Bilt Points and so on — are typically the most flexible reward, although they can also be the most confusing. Depending on the program, you can redeem points to purchase travel through the card issuer's booking portal, redeem them for credit against travel spending or other purchases, transfer them to partner airline and hotel programs, redeem them as cash back, use them to pay for purchases at Amazon or other retailers, or something else.

- Whether cash back rewards or travel rewards are better for you depends entirely on your spending habits and your appetite for complexity. Cash back is the easiest kind of reward to manage — $1 is worth $1 no matter how you use it. So if you want the flexibility to use your rewards for anything without worrying about whether you're getting the "best deal," opt for cash back. With travel rewards, points sometimes have a fixed value (1 cent per point is common), but often the value you get from each point or mile often depends entirely on how you redeem it. You might get 1 cent worth of value per point, you might get a fraction of a cent, you might get multiple cents. Some people love the challenge of squeezing maximum value out of their rewards. See our points and miles valuation page for NerdWallet’s current assessment of how much these rewards should be worth. Learn more here: How to choose between cash back and travel rewards.

- What is a mortgage?
- Most people don't have the cash to simply buy a house. Instead, they use a mortgage, which is a loan to buy a home. After making a down payment of anywhere from 3% to 25%, they get a mortgage to cover the remaining costs of purchasing the home.
- A mortgage is set up so you pay off the loan over a specified period called the term. The most popular term is 30 years. Each payment includes a combination of principal and interest, as well as property taxes, and, if needed, mortgage insurance. (Homeowners insurance may be included, or the homeowner may pay the insurer directly.) Principal is the original amount of money you borrowed while interest is what you're being charged to borrow the money.

- How do mortgage rates work?
- The mortgage rate a lender offers you is determined by a mix of factors that are specific to you and larger forces that are beyond your control.
- Lenders will have a base rate that takes the big stuff into account and gives them some profit. They adjust that base rate up or down for individual borrowers depending on perceived risk. If you seem like a safe bet to a lender, you're more likely to be offered a lower interest rate.
- Your credit score. Mortgage lenders use credit scores to evaluate risk. Higher scores are seen as safer. In other words, the lender is more confident that you'll successfully make your mortgage payments.
- Your credit score. Mortgage lenders use credit scores to evaluate risk. Higher scores are seen as safer. In other words, the lender is more confident that you'll successfully make your mortgage payments.
- Your down payment. Paying a larger percentage of the home's price upfront reduces the amount you're borrowing and makes you seem less risky to lenders. You can calculate your loan-to-value ratio to check this out. A LTV of 80% or more is considered high.

- How (and why) to compare mortgage rates

Financial Tips:
- Mortgage rates like the ones you see on this page are sample rates. In this case, they're the averages of rates from multiple lenders, which are provided to NerdWallet by Zillow. They let you know about where mortgage rates stand today, but they might not reflect the rate you'll be offered.
- When you look at an individual lender's website and see mortgage rates, those are also sample rates. To generate those rates, the lender will use a bunch of assumptions about their “sample” borrower, including credit score, location and down payment amount. Sample rates also sometimes include discount points, which are optional fees borrowers can pay to lower the interest rate. Including discount points will make a lender's rates appear lower.
- To see more personalized rates, you'll need to provide some information about you and about the home you want to buy. For example, at the top of this page, you can enter your ZIP code to start comparing rates. On the next page, you can adjust your approximate credit score, the amount you're looking to spend, your down payment amount and the loan term to see rate quotes that better reflect your individual situation.
- Whether you're looking at sample rates on lenders' websites or comparing personalized rates here, you'll notice that interest rates vary. This is one reason why it's important to shop around when you're looking for a mortgage lender. Fractions of a percentage might not seem like they'd make a big difference, but you aren't just shaving a few bucks off your monthly mortgage payment, you're also lowering the total amount of interest you'll pay over the life of the loan.
- It's a good idea to apply for mortgage preapproval from at least three lenders. With a preapproval, the lenders verify some of the details of your finances, so both the rates offered and the amount you're able to borrow will be real numbers. Each lender will provide you with a Loan Estimate. These standardized forms make it easy to compare interest rates as well as lender fees.
- When you're comparing rates, you'll usually see two numbers — the interest rate and the APR. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is usually the higher of the two because it takes into account both the interest rate and the other costs associated with the loan (like those lender fees). Because of this, APR is usually considered a more accurate measure of the cost of borrowing.

- What's the difference between interest rate and APR?The interest rate is the percentage that the lender charges for borrowing the money. The APR, or annual percentage rate, is supposed to reflect a more accurate cost of borrowing. The APR calculation includes fees and discount points, along with the interest rate.APR is a tool used to compare loan offers, even if they have different interest rates, fees and discount points. APR takes ongoing costs like mortgage insurance into account, which is why it's usually higher than the interest rate.

- What is a discount point?Discount points are basically prepaid interest that reduces the interest rate on your mortgage. One discount point costs 1% of the loan amount, and will usually drop the interest rate by 0.25%.Buying points is optional. Be on the lookout for them, as a lender may add points to a loan offer to make their interest rate seem more competitive. It's up to you to decide if paying for points as part of your closing costs is worth it.The impact of a 0.25% change in the interest rate depends on the loan amount, the term and the interest rates. To illustrate, let's look at a $250,000 mortgage with a 30-year term, and the differences in payment between an interest rate of 4% and a rate of 4.25%.At 4%, the monthly principal and interest cost $1,193.54. At 4.25%, the monthly principal and interest cost $1,229.85. So, for a $250,000 mortgage with a 30-year term, cutting the interest rate from 4.25% to 4% saves $36.31 a month and $436 a year.» MORE: Mortgage points calculator
- Discount points are basically prepaid interest that reduces the interest rate on your mortgage. One discount point costs 1% of the loan amount, and will usually drop the interest rate by 0.25%.

- What is a mortgage rate lock?Mortgage rates not only vary from day to day, but hour to hour. In order to know what rate you'll pay, you need the rate you're offered to stop changing. A mortgage rate lock is the lender's guarantee that you'll pay the agreed-upon interest rate if you close by a certain date. Your locked rate won't change, no matter what happens to interest rates in the meantime.It's a good idea to lock the rate when you're approved for a mortgage with an interest rate that you're comfortable with. Consult with your loan officer on the timing of the rate lock. Ideally, your rate lock would extend a few days after the expected closing date, so you'll get the agreed-upon rate even if the closing is delayed a few days.

Application Process:
- NerdWallet's small-business software content, including ratings, recommendations and reviews, is overseen by a team of writers and editors who specialize in business software, including payroll, accounting and payment processing. Their work has appeared in The Associated Press, The Washington Post, Nasdaq, Entrepreneur, ABC News, Yahoo Finance and other national and local media outlets. Each writer and editor follows NerdWallet's strict guidelines for editorial integrity to ensure accuracy and fairness in our coverage.
- Xero allows an unlimited number of users on a single account at each plan level, a valuable feature in situations where several users need some level of access to the system. And you can assign them different permission levels: For example, one user might only be able to create invoice drafts and submit time entries, while another can view reports but not edit transactions. Competitors’ plans limit how many users you can add, or they charge an additional monthly fee for each user, which can add up quickly. Xero offers a large number of integrations, too.
- Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking)
- More than 750 app integrations, including live, in-house bookkeeping.
- Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking)
- Plus, the software’s mobile-first features — such as the ability to send invoices by iMessage or add widgets to your phone’s home screen to easily access timers and overdue invoices — help you stay on top of operations, even when you're on the go. There’s also an Apple Watch app that lets you track time, send payment reminders and review outstanding invoices.
- Fewer third-party integrations and reports than some competitors.
- Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking)
- Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking)
- Sage 50 Accounting, unlike many of its competitors, is a desktop-based software, making it a good choice for business owners with unreliable internet. All plan levels include inventory management and job costing features, along with Sage’s own cybersecurity offering, which keeps tabs on your business credit score and monitors for data breaches. Business owners working in construction or manufacturing may be especially drawn to Sage 50’s advanced inventory, job costing, reporting and budgeting capabilities.
- Though Sage 50 is technically a desktop-based software product, it advertises some cloud-connected features that add to its functionality. For example, you can use bank feeds to import all your business transactions and speed up the reconciliation process. The program also allows you to back your data up in the cloud and lets you and your team access it remotely.
- Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking)
- Wave is a simple solution for very small businesses that need a place to consolidate bookkeeping records and invoices, but don’t have to log more than a handful of transactions each day. The free version of the accounting software lets you track income and expenses, send unlimited invoices and automatically send reminders for late online payments. It also gives you access to more than a dozen pre-built financial reports, including a profit and loss statement and balance sheet.
- If you don’t want to manually enter transactions into Wave, you can opt for the Pro plan to link an unlimited number of bank and credit card accounts for automated reconciliation. The paid plan offers more competitive online payment processing rates, too (starting at 2.9% per transaction vs. the free plan’s 2.9% + $0.60 per transaction).
- No mileage tracking feature and must use Zapier for third-party integrations.
- Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking)
- QuickBooks Enterprise includes lots of advanced features that quickly growing businesses can benefit from. For example, business owners can set up volume discounts and customize pricing rules according to sales rep, item category or customer in the Platinum plan and up. The same plans help speed up the inventory count process by allowing businesses to use mobile devices as barcode scanners. And unlike some competitors that only track single inventory items, QuickBooks Enterprise lets you track inventory parts plus assemblies. You can also track the cost of goods sold and adjust inventory for loss or shrinkage.
- Limited direct, third-party software integrations.
- Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking)
- These ratings are meant to provide clarity in the decision-making process, but what’s best for your business will depend on its size, growth trajectory and which features you need most. We encourage you to research and compare multiple accounting software products before choosing one. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our editorial guidelines.

Financial Tips:
- 80+ years of combined experience covering small business and personal finance.
- Striven has accounting solutions tailored to multiple industries, including retail and e-commerce, nonprofit, field services, professional services, manufacturing, logistics and transportation, supply chain management and construction. Its retail solution, for example, includes CRM, inventory management and marketing features to integrate with its accounting platform. Meanwhile, its nonprofit solution includes tools for managing records and scheduling events and even a donation portal.
- Monthly costs could add up quickly if you require multiple users.
- Limited third-party integrations available; no payroll integrations.
- Business software integrations (e.g., payroll, HR, CRM, time tracking)
- Yes, but only in Diamond plan and fees apply.
- Recording income and expenses.
- Recording income and expenses.
- Most accounting software goes beyond these tasks with additional built-in modules for invoicing, bill-pay and inventory management, among other functions. The more your accounting software becomes a one-stop shop for these financial chores, the fewer integrations you need to consider.
- Cloud-based software enables access through any device with an internet connection. This generally allows for easier collaboration with accountants and seamless integration with other business software. Desktop-based software, however, can only be accessed from a single computer.
- Accounting software that isn’t intuitive and user-friendly can take up an unnecessary amount of your time or discourage you from using it as often as you should to keep your finances in order. Test out free trials of accounting software, request a demo and watch tutorial videos to get a feel for navigating the software.
- Think about the other types of software you already use or plan to use, and check to see if direct integrations are available between those products and the accounting software you’re considering. If not, you may need to pay for an indirect integration or manually transfer data from one product to another.
- This means your accounting software enters a balancing debit or credit for each transaction, so that you don’t have to do it manually.
- You may have the option to automatically pull transactions from your business’s bank and credit card accounts into your software. This reduces time and error from manual entry.
- Some accounting software products will automatically match your bank and credit card statements with the transactions in your accounting software to ensure alignment, meaning you only have to look them over and approve.
- Many of the popular accounting products can work well for a variety of business types and sizes, but they do come with limits. If you work in an industry with more stringent tax requirements, such as the nonprofit sector or legal professions, or in a field that benefits from detailed and specialized financial reporting, such as construction or manufacturing, then accounting software designed specifically with those needs in mind may be the way to go.
- Accounting software that receives a NerdWallet rating of 5 stars is outstanding among its competition. It delivers great value to users with a range of features and integrations at an affordable — and transparent — price. It also offers multiple avenues for customer support.
- Accounting software that earns 4 or 4.5 stars is excellent. It includes all the standard features and most advanced features but is lacking in areas such as integrations, a mobile app and/or pricing transparency.
- Accounting software with a rating of 3 or 3.5 stars is a solid choice. It lacks certain key features and integrations, and it may also lack pricing transparency. Alternatively, it may be a free product that lacks certain desirable features but offers enough to be worth consideration for businesses on a tight budget.
- In most cases, yes. While you can try using spreadsheets to keep track of your business’s finances, they can become messy and time-consuming. Accounting software is less susceptible to human error and makes it easy to quickly run crucial financial reports, like a profit and loss statement or balance sheet.
- On top of that, double-entry accounting software enters debits and credits for you so you don’t have to worry about manually balancing your books. Ultimately, investing in accounting software will save you time and help make sure your books are accurate.
- Free accounting software can be a great solution for micro businesses that don’t have a large volume of transactions and only need income and expense tracking, basic reporting and invoicing. But even if the basics are sufficient for your business, remember that free products have their downsides.
- For example, Wave’s free accounting plan lacks audit trails, third-party integrations and live customer support. It also doesn’t offer additional plans if your business grows in the future, which means you could eventually have to transfer your data to another provider.

Financial Tips:
- It’s great! You continually get credit score updates, advice, and free reads! I linked all of my accounts and have monthly graphs of what’s coming in and going out, and includes net worth.
- Credit score 101
- A credit score is a three-digit number, usually on a scale of 300-850, that lenders and credit card issuers use to help them decide whether to approve your credit application. The higher your score, the better your chances.
- Borrowers with scores above 750 have a better chance at qualifying for credit cards and loans and getting the best interest rates. Good credit also can save you money. You may qualify for better cell phone deals, pay smaller (or no) utility deposits and pay less for insurance, for example. And some employers and landlords consider credit as well.
- When you or a lender "check your credit," a scoring model from either FICO® or VantageScore® is applied to the current data in one of your credit reports. Your score will vary, depending on which scoring model was used and whether it looked at your credit report from Experian®, Equifax® or TransUnion®. In fact, you really have many credit scores, because of the variety of scoring models and number of credit bureaus. And those scores can vary month to month or day to day as new data gets sent to your credit reports.
- Your credit reports are a record of how you’ve used credit in the past. Credit scores, in turn, interpret the information in your credit reports to estimate the likelihood that you will repay borrowed money. Information about your credit is collected by the three major credit bureaus, Equifax®, Experian® and TransUnion®, as well as some smaller companies. It’s important to check your reports for accuracy so errors aren’t hurting your credit scores.
- The most commonly used credit scoring models range from 300 to 850. Each lender sets its own standards for what constitutes a good credit score. But, in general, scores fall along the following lines:
- Excellent credit: 720 and higher
- Good credit: 690-719
- Fair credit: 630-689
- Bad credit: 629 or lower
- Your credit score is determined by several factors, listed in the order of importance:
- Credit utilization: balances you owe and how much of your available credit you're using.
- Age of credit history: how long you've been using credit.
- Applications: how frequently you've applied for credit recently.
- Type of credit: how many and what kinds of credit accounts you have, such as credit cards, installment debt (such as mortgage and car loans) or a mix.
- A credit score does not consider your income, savings or job security. That’s why, in addition to your credit score, lenders also may check what you owe, how much you earn and assets you have.
- To build your credit score, follow these tips:
- Pay all your bills, not just credit cards, on time. Late payments and accounts charged off or sent to collections will hurt your score.
- Pay all your bills, not just credit cards, on time. Late payments and accounts charged off or sent to collections will hurt your score.
- Use no more than 30% of your credit limit on any card — less, if possible. The best scores go to people using 10% or less of their credit limits.
- Use no more than 30% of your credit limit on any card — less, if possible. The best scores go to people using 10% or less of their credit limits.
- Keep accounts open and active when possible — that gives you a longer payment history and can help your "credit utilization," or how much of your limits you're using.
- Keep accounts open and active when possible — that gives you a longer payment history and can help your "credit utilization," or how much of your limits you're using.
- Avoid opening too many new accounts at once. New accounts lower your average account age and each application causes a small ding to your score. We recommend spacing credit applications about 6 months apart. Make sure you conduct thorough research on the best credit card for your needs before applying.

- If you're just starting out or haven't used credit in at least six months, you might not have a score. Don't worry, NerdWallet has a guide to help you get started with building credit.
- It'll take a few months to generate a score, and then you can follow the tips above and watch your progress on your NerdWallet dashboard.
- Paying late can hurt your credit score, as can having a credit card balance that’s 30% or more of the credit limit. It takes longer to recover from a late payment, which can stay on your credit reports for up to seven years. But the damage from a high balance disappears after you’ve brought the balance down.
- Other negative marks on your credit reports can come from defaulting on an account (not paying as agreed), being sent to collections, having a repossession or foreclosure, or filing for bankruptcy
- Yes! You can sign in to NerdWallet at any time to see your free credit score, your free credit report information — and much more. There's no credit card required, no cost. If you're curious, here's how we make money.
- When you sign up for a NerdWallet account, you get your free credit score and free credit report, updated weekly. NerdWallet provides your VantageScore 3.0® using data provided by the TransUnion® credit reporting bureau.
- Credit scores change frequently as data is added to your credit reports. Checking your credit score weekly is a good habit to develop, so you can see your credit-building progress and watch for signs of trouble.
- Rest easy knowing your data is protected with encryption, multi-factor authentication and other security features. And we use a "soft inquiry" so checking your score won't hurt it.
- NerdWallet partners with TransUnion® to provide your VantageScore® 3.0, based on information in your TransUnion® free credit report. Your score and credit report information is updated weekly. Note that lenders may make their approval decisions using a different credit scoring model or data source.
- Credit scores are everywhere, so choose a score provider that helps you understand the bigger picture.
- NerdWallet explains your score and shows you how you're doing on the factors that influence it most. In the same convenient dashboard, you can see your cash flow and understand your net worth, plus track your debt and see upcoming payments.

- What’s a good reason to refinance?
- Refinancing your mortgage can help you save money, either right away or over time. But there are other good motives, too. Here are some common reasons people choose to refinance.
- Get a lower interest rate. If mortgage rates have dropped since you got your original mortgage, you might be able to refinance at a lower rate. This could reduce your monthly payments.
- Pay off your loan faster. You can refinance from a 30-year mortgage to a shorter term, like 15 or 20 years. Your monthly payment may go up, even if you get a lower rate. But you'll pay less interest over time and own your home sooner.
- Get rid of private mortgage insurance. If you bought a home with a conventional loan and put down less than 20%, you probably have to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI is a temporary surcharge you pay until your mortgage balance reaches 80% of the appraised value. You could hit that milestone sooner if you make extra payments or the value of your home has grown. However, you’ll need a new home appraisal to prove its value.
- Get rid of FHA mortgage insurance. If you have an FHA loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration, refinancing is the only way to get rid of FHA mortgage insurance.
- Change your loan type. If you have an adjustable-rate mortgage and don’t want to worry about rising interest rates, you can refinance to a fixed-rate loan. If you first bought your home with an FHA loan but now qualify for a conventional loan, you might be able to switch.
- Borrow money from your home’s value. Home equity is the market value of your home, minus what you owe. With a cash-out refinance, you borrow more than your current loan balance. The difference is paid to you in cash. A cash-out refinance is a popular way to pay for major home improvements.
- Add or remove a borrower. Let’s say you’re getting a divorce, and you want to remove your ex-spouse’s name from the mortgage. You need to refinance to do that, since your mortgage is an agreement with the lender saying who is responsible for repaying the loan. Similarly, after getting married, you might want to refinance to add your spouse’s name to the loan.
- Lower your monthly payment. Refinancing to a 30-year mortgage can make your payments lower, since you stretch them out over a longer time period. But there’s a catch: A longer loan also means paying more interest over time, so you’ll lose money in the long run. If you're struggling to make payments, other options like forbearance or loan modification might be a better fit.

To qualify, the FHA streamline and VA IRRRL both require that you'll get a financial benefit from the new loan: Either a lower monthly payment or lower interest rate.
- Renovation refinance. A renovation refinance loan works somewhat like a cash-out refinance: You take out a larger loan than what you previously owed. The extra money goes toward fixing up your home. With an FHA 203(k) loan, the lender directly pays your contractor.

- How often can you refinance a mortgage?You can generally refinance as often as it makes financial sense to do so.

- The star ratings on this page reflect each lender's performance in NerdWallet’s refinance category. We scored the category and chose lenders for this page using the following methodology:
- NerdWallet reviewed more than 40 mortgage lenders, including the majority of the largest U.S. mortgage lenders by annual loan volume (measured among lenders with at least a 1% market share), lenders with significant online search volume and those that specialize in serving various audiences across the country.
- All reviewed mortgage lenders that offer more than one refinance product were evaluated based on (1) the portion of their business dedicated to refinance lending, (2) their refinance origination fees, (3) their rate transparency and (4) the ease of their online application. The highest scoring lenders appear on this page.
- NerdWallet solicits information from reviewed lenders on a recurring basis throughout the year. All lender-provided information is verified through lender websites and interviews. We also utilized 2023 data from the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) for origination volume, origination fee, rate spread and share-of-product data.

Financial Tips:
- Nerdy Tip
- It might be easy to refinance with your current lender, but they might not offer you the best deal. To get the best rate, get at least three different quotes — or ask a mortgage broker to shop around on your behalf. See our guide on how to choose a mortgage lender for more shopping advice.
- Is it hard to get approved for a refinance?
- Each lender sets their own requirements to qualify for a mortgage refinance. Here’s a general idea of what to expect.
- Credit score. In general, you’ll need at least fair or average credit to refinance. A higher credit score can help you get a lower interest rate. Government-backed loans usually allow lower credit scores than conventional refinance loans, but each lender sets its own minimums. Bottom line: If your credit could use some polishing, you may want to work on it before applying for a refinance.
- Debt-to-income ratio. Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) shows how much of your money goes to paying bills compared to how much you earn. DTI includes your mortgage payment. Many lenders require a DTI below 36%. You can refinance a mortgage with a higher DTI, but you may pay a higher interest rate.
- Home equity. It’s common for lenders to require you to have 20% equity before you can refinance. However, that amount can vary by lender and type of loan.
- Refinance wait period. While you can refinance as often as you want, some lenders require a waiting, or “seasoning,” period between loans. With a conventional cash-out refinance, for instance, you will have to wait six months. If you are refinancing an FHA, VA or USDA mortgage, the waiting time varies between six and 12 months.
- What are the most common types of mortgage refinance loans?
- Whether you’re looking to refinance a conventional or government-backed mortgage, there are generally four types of refinances:
- Rate-and-term refinance. A rate-and-term refinance is exactly what it sounds like: you refinance your mortgage to reduce the interest rate, alter the length of the loan, or both.
- Cash-out refinance. A cash-out refinance is when you replace your mortgage with a new one for more than your current loan balance. You receive the difference as cash. You can use the money for home improvements or other financial responsibilities. There are conventional, FHA and VA cash-out refinancing options.
- Should I refinance my mortgage?There are multiple reasons to refinance your mortgage. Saving money is a big one: Getting a lower rate brings down your monthly payments, while shortening the term means you'll pay less total interest. A mortgage refinance calculator can help you see how much you could save and when you'll break even.

- Who has the best refinance rates right now?Refinance rates are in constant flux and vary based on economic trends, like job growth and inflation. But the rate you're offered will also depend on your individual financial situation, and factors like your credit score and the loan-to-value ratio of your refinance. Get quotes from multiple lenders to find the best refinance rates.

- NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/calculator/amortization-calculator


Application Process:
- Amortization is the process by which a mortgage gets paid off. Amortization helps lenders reduce their risk and more accurately forecast the money they have coming in each month. Even though each payment on a fixed-rate loan is the same, the proportions of the payment that go toward principal and interest change over time. At the beginning of the loan's term, most of each payment goes toward interest. Over the years, that ratio shifts, and by the last years of the mortgage, payments are going almost entirely to principal.
- For example, let's say you got a $300,000 mortgage for 30 years with an interest rate of 6.5%. Your monthly principal and interest payments will be $1,896, but…
- Using the amortization calculator
- An amortization calculator enables you to see how much interest and principal (the debt) paid will be in any month of your loan. To use our mortgage amortization calculator, simply add your details to the following fields:
- Loan amount.
- Loan amount.
- Mortgage interest rate.
- Mortgage interest rate.
- Loan term, in years.
- Loan term, in years.
- You can also use the amortization schedule to look at how much interest you'll pay over the life of the loan or over a specific period, as well as how much principal you'll still owe at any given time.
- Can I use this mortgage amortization calculator for an adjustable rate mortgage?
- Probably not. The initial fixed interest rate term on an adjustable rate mortgage would be represented well on an amortization schedule. But once that term ends and the interest rate starts to adjust up or down, the schedule can't properly account for future interest rate adjustments.
- The simple answer is: The lender gets paid first. In the early years of your mortgage, your monthly loan payment is heavily weighted to paying interest. Just a tiny reduction of the principal loan balance occurs with each payment at this stage. The rest of your payment often goes to insurance, taxes and other expenses wrapped into the monthly amount due.
- As years pass, you’ll begin to see more of your payment going to principal — a greater amount is reducing the debt and less is being spent on interest.
- How can I pay less interest on my mortgage?
- Making additional, principal-only payments can help chip away your principal in the early years of your loan. Most mortgage lenders and servicers will allow you to add additional funds to your monthly payment; the key is to make sure you designate it as going toward the principal.
- Because the amount of interest paid is based on the principal still owed — that's compounding interest for you — reducing your principal even a little will lower your total interest paid over the life of the loan.
- Test out some scenarios using NerdWallet’s early mortgage payoff calculator, which lets you see how much additional principal you would need to pay each month to chop the desired number of years off your loan's term.
- Another option? If prevailing interest rates are lower than when you took out your mortgage, you could do a rate-and-term refinance to get a lower interest rate. Because refinances come with closing costs — often 2% to 6% of the loan amount — you'll want to be confident that you'll keep living in your home long enough to see savings. But getting a lower interest rate on what's now a smaller loan amount could make your amortization schedule a little less scary. Run the numbers with our refinance calculator to see what you might save.

Financial Tips:
- For those who value simplicity, multiple users suggested getting a good flat-rate card like the Citi Double Cash® Card (the card that came up most frequently in that discussion), the Wells Fargo Active Cash® Card, the Fidelity® Rewards Visa Signature® Card or the PayPal Cashback Mastercard® and then putting all spending on that card.

- Worth noting: The r/CreditCards subreddit is popular with card hackers who might carry a dozen or more cards and excel at squeezing maximum rewards out of them all, so it's common to see suggestions that point to fairly obscure cash back cards or even travel rewards credit cards whose points can be turned into cash with strategic redemption. A post asking for recommendations for a single cash back card that someone can use for every purchase will commonly draw responses encouraging the user to expand their horizons and combine two or more options to enhance their earning.
- So what's Reddit's favorite cash back credit card? It doesn't have one. While r/CreditCards maintains comprehensive lists of cards that earn good cash back in common categories, it isn't going to pick a "winner." Reddit is a huge community of individuals. The r/CreditCards subreddit had 1.4 million members as of September 2024, while r/personalfinance had 20 million. You're never going to get a single definitive answer, because every response is coming from a different individual who has found what works for them. But because so many people are participating, Reddit users offer up a lot of different scenarios that might match your situation, which means the recommendations that accompany those scenarios may have value to you.
- Most popular cash back credit cards

- NerdWallet's Credit Cards team selects the best cash-back credit cards based on overall consumer value, as evidenced by star ratings, as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. Factors in our evaluation include each card's cash-back earning rates, rewards structure (such as flat-rate or tiered categories), annual fee, redemption options (including minimum redemption amounts), promotional APR period for purchases, bonus offers for new cardholders, and noteworthy features such as loyalty bonuses or the ability to choose one's own rewards categories. Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards.
- How do cash-back credit cards work?
- Every time you use a cash-back credit card, the card issuer "pays you back" a certain percentage of the purchase amount. For example, if your card earns 2% cash back on all purchases, and you buy something for $80, then you would earn $1.60 in cash back. Or say your card earns 5% at the gas station; in that case, a $42 fill-up would earn $2.10.
- With most cash-back cards, you can see your accumulated earnings on your monthly statement or through your online account portal, and you can decide when and how to redeem your cash back. Some cards automatically apply your cash back to your account as a credit.
- "Cash back" doesn't mean the card issuer sends you an envelope full of dollar bills. But the rewards do ultimately leave you with more cash in your pocket. The simplest way to redeem cash back is to take it as a credit that reduces your account balance: Redeem $50 worth of cash back, and a $325 balance becomes $275. Many cards also allow you to redeem cash back as a direct deposit into a bank account, and some will even mail you a paper check if you request it.
- What kinds of cash-back credit cards are there?
- There are two basic kinds of cash-back credit cards:
- Is cash back from a credit card taxable?
- Legally speaking, credit card rewards are treated as discounts on purchases rather than as income. That means you don't owe any taxes on your cash back.
- Cash back rewards typically do not expire as long as your account remains open and active. (Exceptions may apply, so check your card agreement.) Some cards may automatically apply your cash back as a credit against purchases on your next statement; others let you save it up and use it when you want.
- From a purely financial standpoint, the best way to use cash back is to redeem it as soon as it is received. Cash back doesn't earn interest, so inflation erodes its value as it sits unredeemed. If you want to put the money into savings, redeem it as a direct deposit into a bank account rather than let it build up. If that's not an option, redeem for statement credit and then put an equal amount into savings.
- Why do credit cards give cash back?
- Credit card issuers give you cash back because doing so encourages you to use their cards. Credit card issuers make money from three main sources:
- Transaction fees paid by merchants who accept credit cards, often referred to as "interchange."
- Transaction fees paid by merchants who accept credit cards, often referred to as "interchange."

Application Process:
- In 2025, the estimated wait time for the IRS to process your tax return and refund is 21 days for e-filed returns. The wait time can increase if you file by paper. Your refund may also be delayed if the IRS finds an error on your return that needs to be corrected.
- Deciding how to take your deductions — that is, how much to subtract from your adjusted gross income, thus reducing your taxable income — can make a huge difference in your tax bill. But making that decision isn’t always easy.
- The standard deduction is a flat reduction in your adjusted gross income. The amount is determined by Congress and meant to keep up with inflation. Nearly 90% of filers take it because it makes the tax-prep process quick and easy. People 65 or older are eligible for a higher standard deduction.
- People who itemize tend to do so because their deductions add up to more than the standard deduction, saving them money. The IRS allows you to deduct a litany of expenses from your income, but record-keeping is key — you need to be able to prove, usually with receipts, that the expenses you’re deducting are valid. This means effort, but it might also mean savings.
- Both reduce your tax bill but in different ways. Tax credits directly reduce the amount of tax you owe, dollar for dollar. A tax credit valued at $1,000, for instance, lowers your tax bill by $1,000.
- Tax deductions, on the other hand, reduce how much of your income is subject to taxes. Deductions lower your taxable income by the percentage of your highest federal income tax bracket. For example, if you fall into the 25% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction saves you $250.

Financial Tips:
- Annual gross income: In this field, enter your total household income before taxes. Include wages, tips, commission, income earned from interest, dividends, investments, rental income, retirement distributions, unemployment compensation and Social Security benefits.
- Where to find it: Your gross income for the year can come from a variety of sources, which then need to be added together. Here's where to find it in two common situations.For W-2 employees, your last paystub of the year will likely include a year-to-date summary with a section outlining your gross pay for the year. You may recieve several 1099s, depending on the type of income you generated. Where your gross income is located (if it's detailed at all) can differ by form type. For example, most independent contractors receive a 1099-NEC, on which gross income can be found in Box 1, "nonemployee compensation."

- IRA contributions: Enter contributions made to a traditional IRA. The IRA contribution limit is $7,000 ($8,000 for those 50 and older). You can make a 2024 contribution until the tax filing deadline in April 2025. An important note: Contributing to a traditional IRA may not have any immediate tax benefits if your income exceeds a threshold set by the IRS and you or your spouse are also covered by a 401(k).
- Other deductions: In this field, enter any other contributions made throughout the year not accounted for elsewhere (e.g., HSA or student loan deduction).
- Tax credits: Enter how much you expect to claim in tax credits on your return. Common tax credits include the child tax credit, the child and dependent care credit, the earned income credit, the EV credit, and the American opportunity credit.

URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/how-to-budget


Application Process:
- Step 1. Figure out your after-tax income
- If you get a regular paycheck, the amount you receive is probably your after-tax income, also called net income or take-home pay. After-tax income is usually just that – the money you have left after federal and state taxes come out. For budgeting purposes, if you also have money taken out of your check for your 401(k), or health or life insurance, add those deductions back in to give yourself a true picture of your savings and expenses.
- If you have other types of money coming in — such as from side gigs — subtract anything that reduces that income, such as taxes and business expenses.
- Record your spending, or try tools such as budget apps or a budget spreadsheet. Pay attention to where your money is going. If you notice areas where you’re overspending, try to cut those costs. If you’re able to make cuts and have money left over, put it toward debt repayment, savings or another financial priority.
- If your income is irregular, set reminders to manually transfer the money when you can. In either case, an accountability partner or online support group can help, so that you're held accountable for choices that don't fit the budget.
- Your income, expenses and priorities will change over time, so manage your budget by revisiting it regularly, perhaps once a quarter. If you find that the initial budgeting system you chose isn’t working for you, consider trying a different strategy. The budget you choose doesn’t have to last forever.
- When budgeting, it can be difficult to determine which items are most urgent. Should you prioritize your credit card debt, student loan repayments or retirement savings? Here is a list of potential priorities from most to least urgent.
- You can’t get out of debt without a way to avoid more debt every time something unexpected happens. And you’ll sleep better knowing you have a financial cushion.
- If you have any extra cash available, go after the toxic debt in your life. High-interest credit card debt, personal and payday loans, title loans and rent-to-own payments all carry interest rates so high that you end up repaying two or three times what you borrowed.
- Investigate options for debt relief, which can include bankruptcy or debt management plans, if either of the following situations applies to you:
- You can't repay your unsecured debt — credit cards, medical bills, personal loans — within five years, even with drastic spending cuts.Your total unsecured debt equals half or more of your gross income.
- You can't repay your unsecured debt — credit cards, medical bills, personal loans — within five years, even with drastic spending cuts.
- You can't repay your unsecured debt — credit cards, medical bills, personal loans — within five years, even with drastic spending cuts.
- Your total unsecured debt equals half or more of your gross income.
- Your total unsecured debt equals half or more of your gross income.
- If you’re able to pay off any toxic debt and have money to spare, the next task is to get yourself on track for retirement. Financial professionals suggest saving 10-15% of your gross income for retirement if that's feasible for you. That 15% includes your company match, if there is one.
- These are payments beyond the minimum required to pay off debt, if you have any remaining.
- If you’ve already paid off your most toxic debt, what’s left is probably lower-rate, often tax-deductible debt (such as your mortgage). Tackle these when the goals listed above are covered.
- Congratulations! You’re in a great position — a really great position — if you’ve built an emergency fund, paid off toxic debt and are socking away 15% toward a retirement nest egg. You’ve built a habit of saving that gives you immense financial flexibility. Don’t give up now. Consider saving for irregular expenses that aren’t emergencies, such as a new pet or your next car. You may also choose to use any disposable income you have to build wealth faster by putting more money in your retirement pot.
- Use 20% of your after-tax income to put something away for the unexpected, save for the future and pay off debt balances (paying more than minimums). Make sure you think of the bigger financial picture. That may mean two-stepping between savings and debt repayment to accomplish your most pressing goals.

Financial Tips:
- You can organize your savings into buckets — emergencies, car repairs and even your next vacation. Have a savings goal that’s falling behind? Redirect those monthly interest payments to get that bucket up to speed. [Quick tip: Some banks will automatically redirect your monthly interest to the bucket of your choice for a hands-off approach.] The more money you save, the bigger those monthly interest payments will be. A total win-win.
- One popular budget plan is the 50/30/20 budget. Over the long term, someone who is able to follow these guidelines will have manageable debt, room to indulge occasionally, savings to pay for irregular or unexpected expenses and the ability to retire comfortably.
- Allow up to 50% of your income for needs
- Your necessities — about 50% of your after-tax income — should include:
- Minimum loan and credit card payments. Anything beyond the minimum goes into the savings and debt repayment category.
- Minimum loan and credit card payments. Anything beyond the minimum goes into the savings and debt repayment category.
- Even if your necessities fall under the 50% cap, revisiting these fixed expenses occasionally is smart. You may find a better cell phone plan, an opportunity to refinance your mortgage or a less expensive car insurance option. Those money moves create breathing room in your budget.
- Leave 30% of your income for wants
- If you're eager to get out of debt as fast as you can, you may decide your wants can wait until you have some savings or your debts are under control. But your budget shouldn't be so strict that you can't buy anything for fun.
- Commit 20% of your income to savings and debt paydown

Financial Tips:
- Nerdy Tip
- Alliant Credit Union
- Overall credit union
- Alliant offers a 3.10% APY on its high-yield savings account, much higher than the average 0.41% APY offered on savings accounts at traditional banks. Alliant also offers a High-Rate Checking account with a 0.25% APY, and share certificates (the credit union equivalent of certificates of deposit) with above-average rates.
- If you don’t qualify for Alliant membership based on Alliant’s general requirements, you can do so by becoming an Alliant Credit Union Foundation advocate; Alliant will pay the $5 membership fee on your behalf.
- Varo offers checking and savings accounts, but it doesn’t offer certificates of deposit. Its savings account comes with a baseline 2.50% APY, but that rate becomes 5.00% for the first $5,000 if customers meet some monthly requirements: Receive $1,000 or more in direct deposits and maintain a positive checking and savings balance at the end of the month. Meeting the requirements in the current month qualifies customers to earn the higher interest rate the following month.
- Linked credit card accounts

Financial Tips:
- CDs are safe investments that can help with some short-term savings goals, and you can find rates higher than regular savings accounts have. But CD rates have started to fall in 2024. And keep in mind that a CD’s fixed rate may not always be enough to protect your cash against inflation. You may need to consider multiple ways to save. See more details in our article on the pros and cons of CDs.
- Generally a CD has an early withdrawal penalty, which can range from a few months' to a year's worth of earned interest, depending on the bank and the CD term length. Longer term lengths usually have bigger penalties. These penalties occur only if you take out money before a CD term expires. Try our calculator to see what an early withdrawal penalty costs. If you want the flexibility of withdrawing early without a penalty, consider a no-penalty CD.
- Share certificates, or certificates, are the credit union equivalent of CDs. A credit union is a not-for-profit banking institution where customers are technically part owners. Owning part of a company means owning shares, hence the use of the word “share” at a credit union. Regular savings accounts are often called share accounts.

- Pros and cons of VA loans
- VA loans are often a good deal for borrowers who qualify — especially if they want to buy without making a down payment. Here are some benefits and one drawback to VA loans.
- Buy with zero down: Qualified VA borrowers may buy without making a down payment.
- No mortgage insurance: Even with a 0% down payment, VA borrowers don’t pay mortgage insurance. Instead, they pay a one-time funding fee.
- Flexible loan qualifying standards: The VA has no minimum credit score requirement, although lenders often require credit scores of 620 or higher. When assessing affordability, the VA looks at how much money is left over after the borrower’s monthly expenses.
- Funding fee: Although VA loans don’t have mortgage insurance, they do have a funding fee that’s paid at closing. The funding fee varies from 1.25% to 3.3% of the loan amount, depending on size of down payment and whether it’s your first or a subsequent VA loan.

- Most students — 42.2 million as of the third quarter of 2024 — borrow money to pay for college. If you're one, you have two types of student loans to choose from: federal or private.
- If you're an undergraduate, always start with federal loans. They don't require a credit history or a co-signer, and they offer more generous protections for borrowers, such as income-driven repayment and loan forgiveness, than private student loans offer.
- Before you borrow, think ahead to how you’ll repay the debt. Use a student loan calculator to estimate the monthly payments you’ll be making every month for 10 years or longer. Borrow only what you need, and don’t take on an amount or interest rate you can’t expect to handle right after graduation.
- Here's how you can get federal and private student loans.

- How to get a federal student loan
- It’s best to start with federal student loans before applying for private student loans.
- Submit a Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, to find out how much financial aid you may qualify for that won’t have to be repaid. This may include grants, scholarships and work-study.
- It takes about 30 minutes to complete the FAFSA. Each school you apply to will use the FAFSA to determine your financial aid; the gap between aid and cost of attendance is what you have to cover.
- 2. Borrow subsidized loans before unsubsidized
- The FAFSA serves as your application for federal student loans as well. There are two types of federal loans: subsidized and unsubsidized.
- Subsidized federal loans go to undergraduate students with a financial need. The subsidy covers the interest on the loan while you’re in school. Unsubsidized federal loans aren’t based on need, and interest starts to accrue immediately.
- You’ll be notified of what you can borrow in the financial aid award letter from any school that accepts you. An award letter will include the financial aid types and amounts you are eligible for, like grants and subsidized and unsubsidized loans. An award letter will also include the cost of attendance, which is an estimate of the tuition, fees, and room and board costs for one year of school.

- How to get a private student loan
- Consider private student loans to cover any remaining costs after grants, scholarships, work-study and federal loans. They're a viable option if you have good credit or a co-signer who does.

Financial Tips:
- Banks, credit unions, state-based agencies and online lenders all offer private student loans. Shop around with multiple lenders, weighing repayment flexibility and forbearance options as well as the interest rates offered.
- » MORE: Compare your private student loan options
- 2. Know the requirements
- Most private lenders require borrowers to have good credit (a credit score above 689) and an income that can support loan payments while meeting other debts (in other words, a low debt-to-income ratio). If you don't meet those qualifications, you'll need a co-signer who does.
- If you don't have a co-signer, a few private lenders offer loans for independent students and consider academic performance and earning potential, but you’ll pay more.
- » COMPARE: Student loans without a co-signer
- 3. Compare lenders before applying for a loan
- Research different lenders and compare their interest rates, repayment terms and consequences for defaulting on a loan. While federal undergraduate student loans currently have a fixed interest rate of 6.53%, private student loans may have variable interest rates that are much higher.
- Student loans for parents and graduates
- Parents and graduate students are eligible for certain federal and private student loans.
- How parents can get student loans
- Parents looking for loans to pay for their child’s education have federal and private loan options available, each of which requires a credit check. There are three primary options to consider:
- • Direct PLUS loans: Direct PLUS loans are the only federal student loan that parents can take. You’ll need to submit a FAFSA with your child and complete a parent direct PLUS loan application to borrow.
- • Co-signed private student loan: Co-signing a loan with your child will make you equal borrowers. It’s best if you have good credit, a steady income and are willing to take on the responsibility of paying the debt if your child can’t.
- • Private college loans for parents: Certain private lenders may offer private college loans for parents to borrow rather than co-signing on a student loan. The debt is your sole responsibility.
- » MORE: Should you co-sign a student loan?
- How graduate students can get student loans
- Graduate student loans include two federal loan options, along with private loans.
- • Federal direct unsubsidized loans. Graduate students can borrow up to $20,500 each year. To apply, submit the FAFSA. There is no credit check involved.
- • Federal direct PLUS loans. Graduate students can borrow up to the cost of attendance minus any other financial aid. Your credit is considered. To apply, submit the FAFSA and complete a graduate student direct PLUS loan application.
- • Private student loans. Apply directly with a bank, credit union or online lender. Your credit history affects the interest rate and repayment terms. Some private lenders may have specific loans for graduate students depending on their field of study. You typically can borrow up to the cost of attendance minus any other financial aid.

Application Process:
- Next steps: using your balance transfer credit card
- 1. Choose a card and apply
- Use our guide above to narrow your options based on the card issuer, 0% APR period, transfer fee and other features, then click the “Apply Now” button for your chosen card.
- Be ready to transfer your debt as soon as possible upon opening the card account. On many cards, the 0% rate is available only on transfers completed within a certain time frame, like 45 or 60 days from account opening; other cards might have an introductory balance transfer fee that gets higher after a similar period.
- With some cards, you can do this from your online account dashboard or even the issuer’s mobile app. With others, you’ll need to call customer service. You might even be asked for transfer information during the application process. You’ll generally need to know:
- The name of the card issuer currently holding the debt.
- The name of the card issuer currently holding the debt.
- The amount of debt you want to transfer.
- The amount of debt you want to transfer.
- The issuer of your balance transfer credit card will set your credit limit for transfers, and it’s not necessarily equal to the overall limit for the card. You could get a card with a $12,000 credit limit, but you might be limited to only $4,000 in transfers. The limit you get might be enough to cover all the debt you hope to move. But as discussed above, you might only be approved for enough to move a portion of the balance. There’s no easy way to tell prior to application, as issuers keep their underwriting formulas confidential.
- The transfer doesn't happen as soon as you ask for it. It can take days or even a couple of weeks. Continue paying at least the minimum on your old card until the account shows that the debt has been moved.
- 4. Pay down the debt on the new card
- Once the transferred debt appears on the new card, start paying it off. Getting an extended break from interest means you can pay more money toward reducing the underlying debt. Make a plan to get it whittled down by the time the 0% period ends — or as soon as possible afterward.

- Common balance transfer credit card mistakes
- A balance transfer credit card can be a powerful tool for getting out from under high-interest credit card debt. But as with any tool, you have to know how to use it for it to be effective. We’ve touched on some of these already, but here are the most common mistakes people make with their balance transfer card.
- We mentioned above that you can’t transfer debt from, say, the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card to the Chase Freedom Unlimited®. That’s because both of these cards are issued by Chase, and you can’t transfer debt among cards from the same issuer. But Chase issues plenty of credit cards that don’t have “Chase” in the name — the United℠ Explorer Card, for example, or the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless® Credit Card. You can’t transfer debt from any of those cards to a Chase-branded card either. So double-check which bank issued your card, regardless of which brand name is on the front.
- If your only significant credit card debt is a $3,000 balance that you want to transfer, and you otherwise have good credit, you have a good chance of getting approved for a balance transfer credit card — and for getting a credit limit high enough to move it all. By contrast, if you have $40,000 in balances spread across a few maxed-out cards, you might not get approved for a balance transfer card at all, no matter how good your credit. Or you might get approved, but not with enough of a credit limit to move much of the debt.
- Card issuers don’t offer balance transfer cards out of the goodness of their hearts. They do it to make money. They can make some money from the transfer fee, and if they can turn you into a long-term customer, they make money from your future business. But they can’t make money if a cardholder transfers debt and then defaults on it. So they’re careful about whom they approve, and for how much.
- That’s why consumers can’t assume that a balance transfer credit card will be a simple solution when they are deep in debt.
- As discussed above, even after requesting a balance transfer, continue making payments on the old card until you see that the debt no longer appears on the account. The transfer process isn’t instantaneous: Your new card issuer has to send the money to the issuer of the old card, and it has to be directed to the proper account.
- This is where some people get tripped up. They request the transfer, then just wait for the balance to appear on the new card. They stop paying attention to the old card and end up missing a payment, incurring a late fee or even damaging their credit. So keep an eye on the old account, and if there’s a payment due, pay at least the minimum.
- Once you’ve moved debt onto a card with a 0% period in effect, it’s critical to make your payments on time every single month. If you’re late, the card issuer could cancel your 0% promotion, and you’ll be back to paying sky-high credit card interest rates on your debt.
- Sometimes finances get tight, and you simply don’t have the means to aggressively pay down your credit card debt, even with a 0% period in effect. In those circumstances, moving debt to a balance transfer card and paying only the minimum for a few months can buy you some breathing room. You do what you have to do.
- You don’t want it to become a habit, though. For one thing, you’re mostly treading water rather than getting ahead. The transfer fee (which usually gets tacked onto the balance you transfer) sets you back at the start, and the minimum monthly payments are fairly small — maybe 1% to 3% of the balance. For another, having debt parked at 0% can encourage you to view that debt as “taken care of” for now, which can in turn encourage more spending and more debt. Then the 0% period runs out and you rush to try to move the balance to another 0% card — playing hot potato with debt rather than getting rid of it.
- Ask our credit card experts
- With a balance transfer, you have to do the math to make sure that balance transfer fee is worth it. If it saves you money compared with the interest you’d pay with your current credit card over time, it can be a useful tool for paying down debt aggressively. Have a strategy in place when using a balance transfer credit card. Curb any habits that may have led to the debt, build an emergency fund to prevent further debt and switch your payment method to debit or cash to make more progress on paying off the balance.
- Writer, credit cards
- Balance transfer credit cards can be good debt management tools because they can save you money on interest payments. But you'll still need to be hands on with your debt and have a repayment plan. A late payment can cause you to lose your introductory 0% APR period and result in a penalty APR that’s higher than the card’s regular rate — which can leave you in a worse financial shape than when you started.
- Writer, credit cards
- Many people hoping to do a balance transfer end up surprised and disappointed when they don't get enough of a credit limit to transfer all the debt they need to move. You might have $20,000 in debt you hope to transfer but only get approved to transfer $3,000.
- Content director, credit cards and travel rewards
- I've used several balance transfer credit cards as successful debt-zapping tools. If you have significant debt, it'll generally be worth paying the balance transfer fee. Even if you don't get a credit limit high enough to tackle all of your outstanding debt, that's fine. You can start small and attack your balance(s) brick by brick.

- Editor, credit cards
- A balance transfer involves moving debt from a high-interest credit card to a new card with a lower interest rate, ideally one with an introductory 0% period. Essentially, you're using one card to pay off another, but because you aren't paying as much in interest, you have more money available to pay down your debt more quickly.
- When evaluating balance transfer credit cards, you'll want to pay attention to:
- The introductory interest rate (APR). Credit cards designed for balance transfers offer a lower interest rate on transfers for a certain period of time after you open the account. Usually, this promotional rate is 0%, but on some cards it might be something like 2.99%.
- The introductory interest rate (APR). Credit cards designed for balance transfers offer a lower interest rate on transfers for a certain period of time after you open the account. Usually, this promotional rate is 0%, but on some cards it might be something like 2.99%.
- The length of the intro APR period. The best balance transfer credit cards offer 15 months or more at 0%. When the promotional period ends, the interest rate shoots up, so you'll want to have your debt paid off by the end of that time.
- The length of the intro APR period. The best balance transfer credit cards offer 15 months or more at 0%. When the promotional period ends, the interest rate shoots up, so you'll want to have your debt paid off by the end of that time.
- The issuer. You typically can't transfer debt between cards from the same issuer. For example, if you have debt on a Citi credit card, you can't move it to another Citi card.
- The issuer. You typically can't transfer debt between cards from the same issuer. For example, if you have debt on a Citi credit card, you can't move it to another Citi card.
- In most cases, you'll need good to excellent credit to qualify for a card with an introductory 0% period. That generally means a credit score of 690 or better. However, credit scores alone aren't the only factor that card issuers take into consideration. A person with an excellent credit score could still be rejected; a person with a score in the mid-600s might still be approved.
- The first step in executing a balance transfer is applying for a balance-transfer credit card. Once you're approved for the new card, tell that card's issuer that you want to do a transfer. (You can sometimes do this through your credit card's online portal or mobile app; in other cases, you'll have to call the number on the back of the card.)
- The new card's issuer will ask for information about the balance you want to transfer, including the financial institution, the account number and the amount of the debt. Depending on your credit limit and the issuer's rules, you may be approved for the full amount of the transfer or only a portion.
- The transfer can take a while, so keep an eye on both accounts until the debt disappears from the old one and shows up in the new one. Make at least the minimum payments on the old account until the debt is transferred.
- Does a balance tranfer help your credit score?
- A balance transfer by itself isn't going to have much of an effect on your credit score. The transfer doesn't make the debt go away; it simply moves it to a new place. In fact, applying for the balance transfer card could knock a few points off your score in the short term.
- What matters is what you do after you transfer your balance. If you take advantage of the breathing room and significantly reduce your debt, your credit can benefit, since the amounts you owe are a significant factor in your scores.
- If you'll have the money to pay off your credit card debt within a month or two, you're probably better off not bothering with a balance transfer. That's because the transfer fee you'd have to pay would probably outweigh any interest that would accumulate during that time. But if paying off that debt will take three or four months, or longer, your interest savings will probably more than make up for the fee.
- If you take advantage of a 0% balance transfer offer to aggressively pay off what you owe, there's no real downside. The money you save on interest can instead go toward eliminating the debt even more quickly. But if all you're doing is "parking" debt on a 0% card and paying only the required minimum without a plan to significantly reduce what you owe, you're only treading water. The 0% period will run out and you'll be right back where you started.
- For a credit card issuer, taking on a consumer's existing debt at 0% interest is a risk, so issuers are careful about whom they approve for a balance transfer. Generally speaking, issuers are reluctant to take balance transfers from people with credit scores much below 700. Each issuer evaluates applications according to its own risk-assessment rubrics; what might be an "easy" card for one applicant to get could be completely unattainable for someone else. As a result, there's no single balance transfer card that you can confidently say is the "easiest" to quality for.
- NerdWallet's Credit Cards team selects the best balance transfer credit cards based on overall consumer value, as evidenced by star ratings, as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. Factors in our evaluation include annual fees, balance transfer fees, the length of each card's 0% introductory APR period, ongoing APRs, credit-profile requirements, cardholders' access to credit scores, and other noteworthy features such as rewards or perks that give the card ongoing value beyond the promotional APR period.

Application Process:
- Bonds are loans made from an investor to corporations or governments. The investor receives interest while the corporation or government uses the loan to fund its operations. Generally speaking, bonds that carry more risk — for example, from corporations rather than the U.S. government — will pay higher returns.
- CDs, sometimes called certificates of deposit, are fixed-income investments typically used for defined-term goals. For example, if you know you need to buy a car next summer, you might put your savings into a 6-month CD where you'll earn a set rate of return. The downside is that unlike the above investments, CDs generally charge a penalty if you need to take money out before the end of the term.
- That said, it helps to have some general guidelines as you use this calculator:
- In an ideal world, you'd run your calculations by plugging in your own expected investment return, based on the specific investments you've chosen. But we know that many people are using this investment calculator to run hypotheticals. Our suggestion: Run the numbers a few different ways, so you get a conservative and aggressive estimate. For the conservative side, knock the above returns down a couple points. For the aggressive, you could add a couple points.

SBA loan rates for 7(a) loans (including Express loans) are calculated based on the daily prime rate plus a lender spread. 7(a) loan interest rates can be either fixed or variable. This calculator assumes a fixed rate. For SBA 504 loans, interest rates are based on the market rate for five- and 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Rates are fixed for the life of the loan[0]U.S. Small Business Administration. 504 loans. Accessed Feb 18, 2025.View all sources.

- Within this calculator, we’ve accounted for one of the most common fees, the SBA guarantee fee. However, there are some additional fees that may affect the cost of your SBA loan.
- Lender guarantee fee. If an SBA 7(a) loan has a term of 12 months or longer, the lender is required to pay an upfront guarantee fee, which is a percentage of the loan amount that varies depending on the size of the loan. The lender can pass this guarantee fee onto the borrower, either adding it to your loan balance or as a separate charge after your loan disbursement.

The lender can pass this guarantee fee onto the borrower, either adding it to your loan balance or as a separate charge after your loan disbursement.
- Annual service fee. Lenders also have to pay the SBA an annual service fee, which is a small percentage of the outstanding balance of the loan, on loans greater than $500,000. This fee cannot be passed onto the borrower.

- It’s important to note that this calculator does not include some fee costs that vary from lender to lender. Your lender can charge service and packaging fees, filing and recording fees, and late payment fees. It can also seek approval from the SBA to charge additional fees if a loan will require an extraordinary amount of work to administer.
- SBA 504 loans require a down payment, so you’ll be asked to choose a payment amount. Because you pay this amount up front, you don’t need to finance it, and it doesn’t count toward your loan total.
- Once you’ve added the above variables, click “calculate” and the calculator will automatically generate your monthly payment, total payments, total interest and amortization schedule. Feel free to play around with the numbers to explore different scenarios.
- Total payments. This is the total amount you will pay back over the life of the loan. It includes the amount you borrowed, plus interest and guarantee fee (if applicable).
- Total payments. This is the total amount you will pay back over the life of the loan. It includes the amount you borrowed, plus interest and guarantee fee (if applicable).
- Total interest paid. This is the total amount you will pay your lender in interest. Repaying your loan early can help you save on interest — as long as your lender doesn’t charge prepayment penalties. The SBA also charges prepayment penalties if you prepay within the first three years of your loan term, if the total loan term is 15 years or longer.

- How to qualify for an SBA loan
- SBA loan requirements can vary depending on the lender you’re working with and which loan program you’re applying for.
- All SBA loans require the following, though:
- You must be a small business. The SBA’s definition of “small business” depends on your annual revenue or number of employees and varies depending on your industry[0]U.S. Small Business Administration. Table of size standards. Accessed Feb 18, 2025.View all sources. You can see the SBA’s business size definitions here.

- Is an SBA loan right for me?
- SBA loans can be one of the most affordable small-business financing options. These loans tend to have long repayment terms, competitive interest rates and can be used for a wide variety of purposes.
- Although SBA loans can be difficult to qualify for, they’re a good option for established businesses with good credit. If you’re considering one of these products, you’ll want to use an SBA loan calculator to estimate potential costs to see if you can afford to take on new debt.
- As you explore different solutions, it’s important to keep in mind that loan features — amounts, repayment terms, interest rates and fees — vary based on your lender and qualifications, so you’ll want to compare several options to find the best deal for your business.

- How do credit card sign-up bonuses work?
- Credit card issuers use sign-up bonuses to encourage people to apply for a card and then, once approved, get in the habit of using it. The term "sign-up bonus" is a bit of a misnomer because in most cases, you don't get a bonus simply for signing up. You earn it by putting a certain amount of spending on your card in the first few months. That's why some issuers use a term like "welcome offer" or "new cardholder offer" rather than "sign-up bonus."
- With a typical sign-up bonus, the time frame for earning the bonus is usually three to six months. The clock starts when you're approved for the card. The more valuable the bonus, the more you'll usually have to spend during that time in order to earn it. For example, a cash back card might offer a bonus of $150 to $200; to earn it, you might have to spend $500 or $1,000. A travel or airline credit card might offer points or miles worth $750 or even $1,000 but will require spending of $3,000 or more. Sign-up bonuses are typically all or nothing — you either spend enough to earn the bonus, or you don't. You won't get half the bonus for spending half the required amount.
- Discover cards are a notable exception to the "all or nothing" nature of credit card bonus offers. Instead of a set bonus amount, the size of your bonus depends on how much you use the card over the first 12 months your account is open. At the end of that period, the issuer matches all the rewards you've earned. For example, here's how Discover describes the bonus offer on the popular Discover it® Cash Back card: "INTRO OFFER: Unlimited Cashback Match for all new cardmembers – only from Discover. Discover will automatically match all the cash back you’ve earned at the end of your first year! There’s no minimum spending or maximum rewards. You could turn $150 cash back into $300."
- Once you hit the required spending amount, you'll get your bonus. With some cash-back cards, the bonus might immediately appear as a credit against purchases on your monthly statement. In most cases, though, the bonus shows up in your rewards balance, alongside the points, miles or cash back you earn from your spending. You can then redeem your bonus however and whenever you want.
- Credit card companies usually set rules about what kind of spending counts toward earning the sign-up bonus. Purchases of goods and services will count. Balance transfers, cash advances and wire transfers will not, nor will purchases of cash equivalents like gift cards, money orders or casino chips. In other words, you can't earn a sign-up bonus by "buying money" and then paying off your balance with that money.
- What credit card has the best sign-up bonus?
- First, bonuses are paid in different kinds of "currency" — cash, statement credits, frequent flyer miles, hotel points and more. That makes it hard to compare bonus values directly. Second, credit card issuers frequently roll out special offers. A card that usually dangles 50,000 points or miles as a bonus might kick that up to 75,000 or 100,000 for a limited time to try to entice people to apply. Targeted offers — that is, those sent out to select consumers rather than advertised to the public at large — can be even more lucrative.
- Travel credit cards tend to offer bigger bonuses than cash back credit cards. Bonus offers on most cash back cards top out at around $200. Travel cards can have bonuses worth $500 or more. However, travel card bonuses come as points or miles that might not be as easy to redeem as $200 in cash.

- Cards with annual fees tend to offer bigger bonuses. When a card charges an annual fee, the issuer knows it needs to sweeten the offer to get you to choose that card over one that charges nothing. So annual-fee cards pay richer rewards, provide better perks — and carry bigger bonuses. For example, the popular Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card charges a $95 annual fee (see rates and fees) and has this offer: Enjoy $250 to use on Capital One Travel in your first cardholder year, plus earn 75,000 bonus miles once you spend $4,000 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening - that’s equal to $1,000 in travel. The Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card - Miles Boost, on the other hand, has a lower offer: Earn a bonus of 40,000 miles once you spend $1,000 on purchases within 3 months from account opening, equal to $400 in travel. But in exchange, it has a $0 annual fee (see rates and fees).

The Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card - Miles Boost, on the other hand, has a lower offer: Earn a bonus of 40,000 miles once you spend $1,000 on purchases within 3 months from account opening, equal to $400 in travel. But in exchange, it has a $0 annual fee (see rates and fees).
- Points and miles are not all created equal. A bonus of 40,000 miles on a Delta Air Lines credit card has a different value from a bonus of 40,000 miles on a Southwest Airlines card. And 50,000 Chase Ultimate Rewards® points are worth more (much more) than 50,000 Hilton Honors points. Apples-to-apples comparisons are difficult with points and miles because they aren't portable like cash — you can only use them in the ways allowed by the program that awarded them. See our page on point and mile values for more information.

- At NerdWallet, we often say that there is no single "best" credit card — just the best card for you. It's the same with bonus offers. The best sign-up bonus is the one that is of greatest value to you.
- How many credit card sign-up bonuses can I earn?
- There's no overall limit to how many times you can earn credit card sign-up bonuses. However, individual card issuers may have rules in place to keep you from earning a bonus on a particular card or "family" of cards more than once. The idea behind such rules is to keep people from applying for the card, earning the bonus, canceling or downgrading the card, then applying anew and earning another bonus. Read the terms and conditions of any bonus offer to see what restrictions are in place.
- What credit card sign-up bonuses are the easiest to get?
- Generally speaking, cash back credit cards have lower spending requirements for earning their bonuses. Depending on the card, you might be able to snag a bonus of $150 or $200 by spending as little a $500.
- Is a credit card bonus taxable income?
- Legally speaking, credit card rewards — including bonuses — are not income. Instead, the IRS considers them a discount or rebate on purchases made with the card. Therefore, they're not taxable.
- This tax treatment is an additional reason why credit card bonuses must be earned through spending, and why the required spending amount is larger than the bonus itself. If you spend $1,000 and get a bonus of $150 for doing so, you don't "come out ahead" — you've still made $850 in net purchases. You've saved some money, but you haven't made any money.
- NerdWallet's credit cards team selects the best credit cards in each category based on overall consumer value. Factors in our evaluation include fees, promotional and ongoing APRs, and sign-up bonuses; for rewards cards, we consider earning and redemption rates, redemption options and redemption difficulty. A single card is eligible to be chosen as among the "best" in multiple categories. Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards.
- How do credit card sign-up bonuses work?
- A sign-up bonus is a promotion offered by a credit card issuer to entice you to apply for a card and begin using it regularly. The term "sign-up bonus" is a bit of a misnomer because in most cases you don't get the bonus just for signing up; you have to earn it by spending money. That's why some issuers use terms like "bonus offer," "welcome offer" or "new cardholder offer" rather than sign-up bonus.
- Sign-up bonuses give you a lump sum of cash back or a large number of points or miles if you spend a certain amount using the card in a specified time period, usually the first few months after opening the account. After you complete the required spending, the bonus is applied to your account. Separate from that lump-sum bonus, or in addition to it, some credit card sign-up offers include a more valuable rewards structure for a limited time (such as a higher rewards rate in the first year) or a special perk for new cardholders (such as free hotel nights or one-time discounts).
- Which credit card has the best sign up bonus?
- The value of a sign-up bonus depends on the type of card. Travel credit cards and small-business credit cards tend to have the highest bonuses. Cards with annual fees typically offer higher sign-up bonuses. Cash-back bonuses are usually lower but easier to earn.
- Bonuses on popular credit cards can range in value from $25 to more than $1,000. As a general rule, new cardholders are required to complete a certain amount of spending on the new card before earning the bonus. With cards that award bonuses in points or miles, the values can differ widely.
- What credit cards give you money for signing up?
- As the name would suggest, cash-back credit cards usually pay their bonuses in cash, as opposed to points or miles. The “cash” might be in the form of a credit on your statement (which reduces the amount you owe), a deposit into a bank account, or even a mailed check.

- NerdWallet’s life insurance ratings are determined by our editorial team. Star ratings are based on consumer experience, weighted averages of financial strength ratings, which indicate a company’s ability to pay future claims, and complaint index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for individual life insurance. To calculate each insurer’s rating, we adjusted the scores to a curved 5-point scale.
- These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare life insurance quotes from several companies to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our editorial guidelines.
- Buy online. This indicates whether an insurer allows you to apply for and buy a policy completely online.

- NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.

Financial Tips:
- The insurer offers a child term rider that can cover multiple children. You can also choose to add a waiver of premium rider or accelerated death benefit rider to your coverage for an additional fee.

Application Process:
- We did the research by testing and evaluating four well-known, widely used online tax providers. Our review process includes first-hand testing and information collection, focusing on factors that are important to filers: price, ease of use, tools, tax pro help and customer support. (Prices are updated monthly and are accurate as of March 4, 2025.)
- If you're new to filing or just need a little more guidance, you can also check out our tax software guide further down on the page, which covers the ins and outs of picking tax software.
- Quality tax software should also facilitate the refund or payment process between you and the tax entity. This means you can pay your tax bill directly via the software or supply your banking info to the provider to initiate the refund process.
- How much you pay for tax software is often a function of how complex your taxes are or how much help you need. People with fairly simple situations — such as W-2 income only and very few credits to claim — may be able to take advantage of the "free version" many commercial programs offer. However, state returns may not always be included in these offers. Outside of this, the IRS and other state tax departments also offer free tax filing services, such as Direct File and Free File.
- If you need to itemize, have a lot of investment income, freelance or are self-employed, you'll need access to more complicated forms, which often means paying for higher-tiered tax prep packages that offer more support and tools. Some packages also come with paid upgrades or separate products that give you access to a tax pro — such as a CPA or an enrolled agent — who can collaborate with you on a return. These add-ons will typically up your total, but people who want to DIY with just a little support might find it worth the price.
- Software that feels like an interview — asking questions about your income and any life events that might allow for deductions — offers more guidance than a basic fill-in-the-blank process. The ability to import forms such as W-2s is better than having to manually type in numbers.
- Even with the best tax software programs, there's a chance you might run into a technical issue or need some help as you move along the filing process. If this is important to you, make sure to take a close look at what customer help options are available to you — phone, email, chat or video call — and hours of availability.
- The best software should walk you through the filing process, can handle most tax forms and specialty income, and will tell you whether it’s better to take the standard deduction or itemize, for example.
- NerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and ranks the largest online tax software providers. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of available software to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgements on which ones will best meet your needs. We adhere to strict guidelines for editorial integrity.
- We collect data directly from providers, do first-hand testing and observe provider demonstrations. Our process starts by sending detailed questions to providers. The questions are structured to equally elicit both favorable and unfavorable responses. They are not designed or prepared to produce any predetermined results. The provider’s answers, combined with our specialists’ hands-on research, make up our proprietary assessment process that scores each provider’s performance.
- The final output produces star ratings from poor (1 star) to excellent (5 stars). Ratings are rounded to the nearest half-star. For more details about the categories considered when rating tax software and our process, read our full methodology.

Financial Tips:
- 🤓 Nerd Tip: If your adjusted gross income for 2024 was $84,000 or less, you might be able to get free tax software from some of these providers through the IRS' Free File program. Plus, there are a few more options for free tax filing.
- TurboTax stands out across the board, scoring high marks for categories such as ease of use, features and tools. Working with the software feels like an interview with a tax preparer who knows just what to ask and how best to guide you.
- Similar to other providers we review, the free DIY package covers only simple tax situations. This package might only make sense for you if you have W-2 income and need help with claiming basic tax breaks such as the child tax credit and the student loan interest deduction.
- The paid packages — the Deluxe and Premium tiers — come at a higher cost relative to other tax-prep software we reviewed, but many filers might find the stellar user experience and innovative features justify the price. The Deluxe tier can help filers who itemize or are homeowners, while the Premium is better suited for investors or people with freelance or self-employment income.
- Roughly 37% of taxpayers are eligible. TurboTax Free Edition supports a simple Form 1040 and no schedules except for the earned income tax credit, child tax credit and student loan interest.
- Itemize and claim several tax deductions and credits. Works well for business income but no expenses.
- Investment reporting and rental income (Schedules D and E, and K-1s), plus business income, expenses on a Schedule C, home office deductions and features for freelancers.
- Like many other providers, H&R Block's free version has no income restrictions and can handle Form 1040, income from wages, limited bank interest, student loan interest (1098-E), and limited Schedules 1, 2 and 3 (but you may need to upgrade if you need other forms to complete the schedules).
- If you need help with itemized deductions, investing income, freelance or self-employed work, or HSA distributions, you'll need to upgrade to the Deluxe, Premium or Self-Employed editions.
- Itemize and claim several tax deductions and credits. Works well for business income but no expenses.
- User experience: In our analysis, no one quite beats TurboTax when it comes to user experience, but H&R Block is a close runner-up. The interface is clean and seamless, and manual entry is eliminated as much as possible throughout when it comes to uploading forms like your W-2, some 1099s and other financial records. It's easy to add credits and deductions as you go, context-sensitive help is widely integrated and the help button is easily accessible wherever you are.
- TaxSlayer takes the cake for the most affordable tax software this filing season. Not only are its paid packages the least expensive of those we review, but TaxSlayer shakes up the norm by offering all forms, deductions and credits at its lowest-price tier. The only difference between the paid packages is how much support you get from a tax pro.
- Similar to its big-name competitors, TaxSlayer's free version only supports simple tax situations. If you just need to file a simple 1040 and don't need to claim any dependents or common tax credits, you may be able to take advantage of the deal. However, TaxSlayer is a bit stricter than its peers in what it considers a "simple tax situation," with income limits and filing status restrictions in place.
- Allows you to file a 1040 and a state return for free, but only if you have a very simple tax situation: your taxable income is $100,000 or less, you don’t claim dependents, you don’t itemize, you didn’t sell stock, have rental income or a business, and you don’t take the earned income tax credit.
- All forms, deductions and credits.
- All forms, deductions and credits. Includes Ask a Tax Pro.
- Includes all forms, deductions and credits, and tax support from the Premium tier. Includes specialized support for self-employment needs and audit defense.
- Free version: TaxSlayer's free version has many restrictions that make it unusable for a large number of filers. Taxpayers who have a relatively high taxable income, don't fall into the single or filing jointly status, or want to claim common tax credits or dependents may find that other providers' free versions are a better option.
- Donation calculator: A donation calculator is a common tax software feature that helps you calculate the deduction value of items you've donated. TaxSlayer's lack of a donation calculator may make the software less attractive to itemizers who plan to deduct charitable contributions.
- TaxAct's free version is similar to other providers: it's only for those with simple tax situations. It's reserved for filers who are taking the standard deduction and don't need to claim many deductions or credits. However, it's worth noting that most free tax software packages include a free state return, but TaxAct charges a $39.99 fee for each state filed.
- Like most other providers, TaxAct's paid packages vary in which forms, deductions and credits they support. People with trickier tax situations — homeowners, investors, small-business owners — may opt for TaxAct's Deluxe, Premier or Self-Employed tier.
- For dependents and simple filers who need help with college expenses, unemployment or retirement income.
- This option is ideal for homeowners and those who need to consider child care expenses or certain deductions, credits and adjustments.
- Affordability: Across the board, TaxAct’s offerings are less expensive than similar products from competing providers. That’s a nice score — especially for filers who value function over form and want affordable human help if necessary.
- Free version: Most providers let you file one state tax return — if not multiple — for free when using the free version of its software. TaxAct, however, charges $39.99 for each state return you file. If you're eligible to use TaxAct's free version, it's worth considering whether you might also qualify for TurboTax's or H&R Block's free version, which both let you file multiple state returns at no cost.
- Income limitation?
- 1040, Schedule 1, 2, and 3 (limited), earned income tax credit, child tax credit, unemployment income, student loan interest, tuition and fees, certain retirement income, lifetime learning credit, and American opportunity tax credit.
- 1040, earned income tax credit, child tax credit, unemployment income, certain retirement income, lifetime learning credit and American opportunity credit.
- 1040, unemployment income, student loan interest, lifetime learning credit, American opportunity credit.
- 1040, earned income tax credit, child tax credit, student loan interest, certain retirement income.
- Roughly 37% of taxpayers are eligible. TurboTax Free Edition supports Form 1040 and limited tax credits only.
- Federal: $69 to $129. Free version available for Form 1040 and limited credits only. Roughly 37% of filers qualify.
- Federal: $69 to $129. Free version available for Form 1040 and limited credits only. Roughly 37% of filers qualify.
- These star ratings are based on a tax provider's free tier score. For more detailed scoring, see the full product details drop-down menu above. Providers frequently change pricing. You can verify the latest price by clicking through to each provider's site.
- Guide to tax software
- Tax software helps filers complete and submit their federal and state income tax returns using a DIY program. Due to its convenience and accessibility, it's by far one of the most popular filing methods.
- You can sign up for tax software online via the provider's website. There may be multiple packages to choose from — but generally, the more complex your taxes are, the more you can expect to pay. The program will then guide you through your federal and/or state taxes by asking a series of interview-style questions that will help it populate tax forms on the backend.
- If you find a provider that excels in the areas above, you then want to choose the package that covers all of the tax forms and schedules you need. People with simple tax situations may not need anything but a package that covers your basic Form 1040. On the other hand, people with multiple jobs, itemizers, and those with business, investing or rental income will typically need access to additional schedules and forms, which can mean paying for a higher-tiered package.
- Carter-Gray, an enrolled agent, says working with a tax pro may be the better option if you’re getting overwhelmed with questions, made a large transaction you’re unsure how to handle, had multiple income streams or various investments — or if you’re simply just seeking more tax planning.

Application Process:
- A business plan outlines your business’s financial goals and explains how you’ll achieve them over the next three to five years. Here’s a step-by-step guide to writing a business plan that will offer a strong, detailed road map for your business.
- A business plan is a document that explains what your business does, how it makes money and who its customers are. Internally, writing a business plan should help you clarify your vision and organize your operations. Externally, you can share it with potential lenders and investors to show them you’re on the right track.
- Business plans are living documents; it’s OK for them to change over time. Startups may update their business plans often as they figure out who their customers are and what products and services fit them best. Mature companies might only revisit their business plan every few years. Regardless of your business’s age, brush up this document before you apply for a business loan.
- Your company description should also define your business structure — such as a sole proprietorship, partnership or corporation — and include the percent ownership that each owner has and the extent of each owner’s involvement in the company.
- If you’re looking for a business loan or outside investment, you can use this section to explain how the financing will help your business grow and how you plan to achieve those growth targets. The key is to provide a clear explanation of the opportunity your business presents to the lender.
- For example, if your business is launching a second product line, you might explain how the loan will help your company launch that new product and how much you think sales will increase over the next three years as a result.

- » MORE: Read our complete guide to small business marketing
- If you’re a startup, you may not have much information on your business financials yet. However, if you’re an existing business, you’ll want to include income or profit-and-loss statements, a balance sheet that lists your assets and debts, and a cash flow statement that shows how cash comes into and goes out of the company.
- Net profit margin: the percentage of revenue you keep as net income.
- Net profit margin: the percentage of revenue you keep as net income.
- Current ratio: the measurement of your liquidity and ability to repay debts.
- Current ratio: the measurement of your liquidity and ability to repay debts.
- Accounts receivable turnover ratio: a measurement of how frequently you collect on receivables per year.
- Accounts receivable turnover ratio: a measurement of how frequently you collect on receivables per year.
- This is a critical part of your business plan if you’re seeking financing or investors. It outlines how your business will generate enough profit to repay the loan or how you will earn a decent return for investors.
- Here, you’ll provide your business’s monthly or quarterly sales, expenses and profit estimates over at least a three-year period — with the future numbers assuming you’ve obtained a new loan.

- Avoid over-optimism: If you’re applying for a business bank loan or professional investment, someone will be reading your business plan closely. Providing unreasonable sales estimates can hurt your chances of approval.
- Use free resources: SCORE is a nonprofit association that offers a large network of volunteer business mentors and experts who can help you write or edit your business plan. The U.S. Small Business Administration’s Small Business Development Centers, which provide free business consulting and help with business plan development, can also be a resource.

- You're starting a new business. A 0% APR business card can be a good business credit card for startups. You can use these cards to finance business expenses while you’re building cash flow.
- You need to finance large purchases, but don’t qualify for small-business loans. Business loans charge interest from the start. So even if you can qualify for one, using a credit card with a 0% APR intro offer and paying it off quickly may be a cheaper form of financing.
- You have a pay-off plan. You have to pay the ongoing APR on any outstanding balance after an intro APR period ends — and those interest rates tend to be high. If you might take months or even years beyond an intro APR period to pay off your debt; using a credit card may be very expensive in the long run.

- Is a 3-month CD too short to be useful?The benefit of a 3-month CD is that you can take advantage of multiple renewals in one year. You have more access to funds than other CDs while still taking advantage of a fixed rate.You could also build a short-term CD ladder, which might look like this: Open a 3-month, 6-month, 9-month and 1-year CD; when each one matures, open a new 1-year CD. You can end up with four CDs maturing in the second year, or withdraw funds at any maturity if you need them.
- The benefit of a 3-month CD is that you can take advantage of multiple renewals in one year. You have more access to funds than other CDs while still taking advantage of a fixed rate.
- When should you get a CD?You should get a CD only if you know you won’t need those funds during its term. Pulling money out of a CD before its expiration date will likely result in an early withdrawal fee, which is typically a percentage of the interest earned. With a three-month CD, there’s less of a commitment, so you have more opportunities to renew in a given year if you decide you don’t need the money yet. If you're thinking of a longer term for higher yields, check out our lists of best one-year and best three-year CD rates.

- How do CD rates work?CD rates are quoted as an annual percentage yield, or APY, which is how much the account earns in one year, including compound interest. Banks generally compound interest monthly or daily. Most CDs have fixed rates, so they won't change as savings account rates tend to.» See what CDs can earn with our CD calculator

- Is laddering short-term CDs a good idea?A CD ladder can be a helpful strategy if you don’t want to go all in on one CD, especially if you want to catch higher CD rates down the road. It works like this: You open multiple CDs at different terms, such as three months, six months, and one year, which frees up part of your funds more regularly than having, say, just a three-year CD. Each time a CD matures, you can either reinvest in a new CD or withdraw your money. Learn more about CD ladders.

- F) MASS, COLLECTIVE, OR BATCH ARBITRATION. YOU AND NERDWALLET AGREE THAT ADMINISTRATION OF ANY MASS, COLLECTIVE OR BATCH ARBITRATION SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE TERMS SET FORTH IN THIS SUBSECTION (F). You and NerdWallet agree that a “mass, collective, and/or batch arbitration” includes, but is not limited to, instances in which you and others are represented by a law firm or collection of law firms or legal counsel that has filed more than 150 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature against NerdWallet, alleging similar or identical claims or causes of action, within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on your or others behalf, and the law firm or collective of legal counsel/law firms seeks to simultaneously or collectively administer and/or arbitrate all the arbitration demands together. If more than 150 arbitration demands of a substantially similar nature, alleging the similar or identical claims or causes of action, are filed against NerdWallet by the same law firm or collection of legal counsel/law firms within 180 days of one another, each arbitration demand must be filed, administered, arbitrated, and resolved pursuant to this subsection (f).
- Specifically, in order to increase the efficiency of resolution for any mass, collective, and/or batch arbitration, in the event 150 or more similar arbitration demands against NerdWallet are filed within a 180 day period pursuant to the above, the arbitration provider shall (i) group the arbitration demands into batches of no more than 150 demands per group; and (ii) provide for resolution of each group or batch as a single arbitration with one set of filing and administrative fees and a single arbitrator assigned per group or batch. You and NerdWallet agree to cooperate in good faith with the arbitration provider to implement the aforementioned protocol for mass, collective, and/or batch arbitrations with regard to resolution, fees and administration. If subsections (f)(i) or (f)(ii) are not enforced, or the arbitration provider refuses to follow these specific mass, collective, and/or batch arbitration protocols, then each arbitration demand must be filed, administered, arbitrated, and resolved individually, or the parties agree to seek out a different, mutually agreeable and widely-recognized arbitration organization agreeable to follow subsections (f)(i) or (f)(ii). If any other portion of this subparagraph (f) is found to be unenforceable, then the unenforceable portion of the provision shall be stricken, and the remainder of subparagraph (f) and this agreement shall be enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.  Mass, collective, and/or batch arbitrations shall otherwise be subject to all other substantive and procedural terms contained within this agreement.
- h) Injunctive Relief. Notwithstanding the Arbitration Agreement, you acknowledge that money damages are an inadequate remedy for unauthorized access to or use of the Services or your breach of any provisions in the Terms relating to NerdWallet’s intellectual property rights, and any such breach would result in irreparable harm to NerdWallet. Accordingly, in the event of any such actual or threatened breach, NerdWallet may, in addition to any other rights or remedies available to NerdWallet at law or equity, seek specific performance or injunctive relief without the posting of a bond.
- i) Modifications. If NerdWallet makes any future change to this Arbitration Agreement (other than a change to the Notice Address) after your enrollment in a service or program or your use of the Services, you may reject any such change and require NerdWallet to adhere to the language in this arbitration provision as written at the time of your enrollment or purchase if a dispute between us arises, by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. You acknowledge and agree that, in the event you reject any future change, your account with NerdWallet shall be immediately terminated and you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as written at the time of your enrollment or purchase.
- j) Severability and Enforceability. If an arbitrator or court decides that any part of this Section 13 is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Section 13 shall still apply. If the entirety of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable, then the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 12 shall govern any action arising out of or related to the Terms, and that the remainder of the Terms will continue to apply.
- f) Third-Party Beneficiaries. NerdWallet’s former and past employees, directors, officers and contractors, and each of their successors and assigns, are intended beneficiaries of Section 7 (Indemnification) and the Arbitration Agreement and have the right to enforce such provisions against you. The Terms are not otherwise intended to grant rights to anyone except you and NerdWallet or create any third-party beneficiary rights.

Before signing up for a new account to earn a bank bonus, understand the details including what fees might be incurred and how long you might have to wait for the bonus to be paid. If earning a bank sign-up bonus requires depositing more than $250,000 (which is the standard amount that’s insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.), you’ll need to employ certain strategies to make sure that all your money — including funds over $250,000 — is protected.
- The best bank promotions offer the opportunity to earn a significant cash bonus for signing up for a new account with no fees or fees that are easy to get waived. The best bank bonuses for you are ones that have requirements you're comfortable with, including the amount of time you'll have to keep your money in the account to earn the bonus.

Married or partnered people, for example, might each want to have their own accounts in addition to one or more shared accounts. You might want to consider having accounts at different financial institutions for different purposes — such as having an account with a bank that works well for international travel if you’re frequently abroad, or with the bank that handles your mortgage or other loans for more seamless payment transfers. (Learn the pros and cons of keeping multiple bank accounts at different banks.)

- Chase Private Client Checking offers a bonus of up to $3,000 for opening a new account. Read the promotion details above to understand all the rules and requirements to earn the checking account bonus, including a super steep minimum transfer amount that may not be worthwhile.

- How we picked the best lenders for bad-credit loans
- Our editorial team of personal loan experts compared more than 35 lenders to choose the best personal loans for bad credit. These lenders not only accept lower credit scores, they also have features to help borrowers qualify, successfully repay their loans and boost their scores. Here are the factors we considered.
- We considered lenders’ minimum credit score requirements as well as their average borrowers’ credit scores. Also factored in: Do they offer alternative loan types (co-signed, joint or secured) to help borrowers qualify?
- Many lenders offer personal loans for bad credit, but the best bad-credit lenders are able to charge low APRs and some provide at least one rate discount. We considered only lenders with APRs below 36%.
- Making on-time monthly repayments can improve your credit, and the best lenders help by reporting your repayment history to all three credit bureaus. They also let you change a payment due date and get on a hardship program if needed.

- RequirementsYou may have a tougher time qualifying for a personal loan with bad credit, but many lenders accept lower scores and weigh them equally with alternative factors. Narrow your search to lenders with credit score, income and other requirements you can meet.

- Bad-credit loan interest rates and fees
- The average pre-qualified personal loan rate for a bad-credit borrower was 21.72% in January 2025, according to aggregate, anonymized data from NerdWallet. Consumer advocates say the highest APR an affordable loan should have is 36%.
- Borrower credit rating
- Score range
- Source: Average rates are based on aggregate, anonymized offer data from users who pre-qualified through NerdWallet from February 1, 2025, through February 28, 2025. Rates are estimates only and not specific to any lender. The lowest credit scores — usually below 500 — are unlikely to qualify. Information in this table applies only to lenders with maximum APRs below 36%.
- One of the most common bad-credit loan fees is an origination fee, which is often 1% to 10% of the loan amount. The fee is included in your APR, but a lender may take it before sending you the funds, effectively reducing your loan amount, or add it to your monthly payment.
- For example, a two-year, $10,000 loan with a 20% interest rate and a 5% origination fee has an APR of 25.14%. If the lender takes the origination fee before sending you the loan, you’d receive $9,500 and the lender would keep $500.

- Bad-credit loan pros and cons
- Some lenders can approve a loan application instantly, while others may take a day or two. Once approved, funding can happen the same day or take a couple of days.
- Unlike most credit cards and credit lines, personal loans usually have fixed interest rates, meaning you’ll have the same monthly payment for the full loan term.
- Payment history is the biggest factor that determines your credit score, so paying on time can give you a big boost.
- Though a low credit score often results in high personal loan rates, your rate may still be lower on a personal loan than some credit cards and other high-interest loans.
- Bad-credit borrowers can expect an annual percentage rate on the high end of a lender’s range. Personal loan rates max out at 36%, and it‘s possible someone with a low score could get a 20% APR or higher.
- Minimum credit scores among bad-credit lenders are often between 550 and 600. A score that meets the minimum requirement doesn’t guarantee approval, and those with scores below the requirement are unlikely to qualify.
- If you fail to qualify for a personal loan, the lender may suggest you add a co-signer or get a secured loan. These options may help you qualify, but late payments will put your collateral or co-signer’s credit at risk.
- Predatory lenders — those that use deceptive practices to provide potentially harmful loans — may seek out consumers with low credit scores who fear they won’t qualify elsewhere.
- Where to get a personal loan for bad credit
- Some online lenders offer personal loans specifically for bad-credit borrowers. These lenders may consider information beyond your credit and income to qualify you, though those are still major factors in a loan decision.
- Credit unions rely more on traditional information like credit and income but may also consider your history as a member. A member in good standing may qualify for a personal loan from a credit union despite a low credit score.
- Nerdy Tip
- Some local banks and credit unions may be willing to look past a minor factor dragging your credit score down, such as a recent missed payment or closed credit account, and consider your whole financial picture when making a loan decision. For this reason, your local financial institution may be a good place to shop for a bad-credit loan.
- How to apply for a loan
- Check your creditReview your credit reports from the three major credit bureaus to ensure the information is accurate and up to date. Fixing errors on your report before applying may improve your chances of qualifying. You can get your credit reports for free on NerdWallet or at AnnualCreditReport.com.In addition to your credit, lenders will consider the following on a loan application:Income: Many lenders accept income from employment, alimony, retirement, child support and social security payments. Showing a lender that you have enough income to make the payments is crucial to approval, so be sure to include all sources of income when you apply.Debt-to-income ratio: This is the percentage of your monthly income that goes to debt payments. Lenders typically like to see that you can cover your monthly bills, including any other loan or credit card payments, and have money left over after your new personal loan payment.Co-applicant and collateral: If the lender offers a co-signed or secured loan, the person or item you add to the application becomes a factor in deciding whether you qualify.

- Pre-qualify with multiple lendersMany lenders let you pre-qualify to preview potential loan offers without affecting your credit score. You provide some information about yourself, like your income, desired loan amount and loan purpose, and the lender does a soft credit pull — which doesn’t impact your score — to determine your potential loan rate, amount, repayment term and monthly payment. No two lenders have the same borrowing requirements, so it pays to pre-qualify with multiple lenders.

Many lenders have online personal loan applications but your local bank or credit union may require an in-person application. The lender will do a hard credit check when you apply, causing your score to temporarily drop by a few points. If approved for the loan, you can usually expect to receive funds within a few days.

- Build your credit
- In most states, insurers can use your credit-based insurance score (similar to your FICO score) to set rates. Because some studies have shown a correlation between poor credit and filing claims, those with a checkered credit history may pay more for homeowners insurance. Though it may take time, building your credit could save you a lot on homeowners insurance over the long run.
- Your homeowners insurance might cost more than expected if your home is older, your region is at high risk for natural disasters or you have poor credit, among other factors. Insurers are also raising rates because climate change is making certain types of disasters more severe. But every insurance company prices policies a little differently. So if you’re unhappy with your rate, get quotes from at least three other companies to see whether you can find a better deal.

- Offers five loan terms, which is more than most lenders.
- Not available to borrowers enrolled in two year programs at community colleges.
- What are the best student loans for graduate students?
- If you need loans to pay for graduate school, the best option will likely be federal student loans. Federal loans don't require good credit, and they offer benefits that private graduate school loans may lack, including income-driven repayment plans, loan forgiveness programs and multiple repayment options.
- Those benefits can come in handy depending on how much you owe. The average graduate student debt is $88,220, including undergraduate loans, according to  the National Center for Education Statistics.
- Whether you opt for federal or private loans, most lenders won't require you to pay student loans while in graduate school, provided you're enrolled at least half-time. But depending on how much you get paid as a graduate student, making payments can save you money because graduate school loans accrue interest, even while you’re in school.
- Federal student loans for graduate students
- Borrowers are eligible for two types of federal loans for graduate school: unsubsidized direct loans and grad PLUS loans. Certain graduate students may be eligible for a federal health professions student loan as well.
- Federal direct unsubsidized loans
- Federal direct unsubsidized loans are available for undergraduate and graduate students, and you don’t need to demonstrate financial need to be eligible. The amount grad students can borrow is $20,500 annually and $138,500 overall, including undergraduate loans. For graduate students, these loans hold a fixed interest rate of 8.08% with a loan fee of 1.057%.
- Federal direct grad PLUS loans
- Federal grad PLUS loans have higher interest rates (9.08%) and fees (above 4%) than direct unsubsidized loans, but you can borrow more money — up to your total cost of attendance, minus other aid received.
- Use grad PLUS loans if you’ve maxed out your federal direct unsubsidized loans at lower interest rates and still want to use federal loans to pay for graduate school.
- Grad students with direct unsubsidized or PLUS loans who go on to work at a nonprofit or governmental organization may be eligible for loan forgiveness after 120 qualifying monthly payments through Public Service Loan Forgiveness.
- » MORE: Public Service Loan Forgiveness: What it is, how it works
- Can graduate students get subsidized loans?
- Direct subsidized loans help undergraduate students with financial need obtain better borrowing terms, but subsidized loans for graduate school are no longer offered.
- Private student loans for graduate students
- There is no shortage of private student loan options for graduate students. You may even pay less with a private graduate school loan than a federal loan if you or a co-signer has excellent credit and qualify for a low rate.
- Compare private student loans
- Before committing to a private student loan, compare interest rates and whether other factors like your field of study or career choices could impact your borrowing capabilities.
- It's best to check rates from multiple lenders before applying to ensure you get the best rate possible. Additional items to compare across lenders include:
- Credit score and co-signer requirements.
- Credit score and co-signer requirements.
- If you’ve exhausted federal loan options, consider applying for private graduate student loans after researching and comparing interest rates and terms from multiple lenders such as banks, credit unions and online companies.

- How to get a startup business loan
- Personal credit score: Although some online lenders offer startup business loans for bad-credit borrowers (those with a personal credit score below 630), be wary of any lender that offers startup loans with no credit check or guaranteed approval. It could be an expensive option — or a scam. You’ll typically need a personal credit score of 500 or higher; otherwise, you may need to build your credit before applying.
- Personal finances. Your personal finances will likely weigh heavily into your startup business loan application. A lower debt-to-income ratio and higher personal credit score are ideal to qualify for the best rates.
- Available collateral. It can be helpful to offer substantial collateral on your loan application, even when it’s not required. In general, anything you can use to show your creditworthiness and ability to repay the financing will help you qualify for a startup business loan — as well as help you access more competitive rates and terms.
- Consider a cosigner. A cosigner on a business loan acts as a second guarantor and can help improve your chances of approval with a lender. If you know a trustworthy person with good personal credit and assets, it may be worth asking them if they’d consider cosigning your startup loan, if needed. However, keep in mind that if you default on the loan, the cosigner’s credit will be adversely affected in addition to your own.

- Mortgage interest rates are constantly changing, and if you're trying to watch and wait for the 'right' time to jump on a deal, you're likely going to be frustrated.  Homebuying is a lengthy process at the best of times, and it's also very personal. A generic interest rate you might see advertised isn't customized to your situation, and it probably won't be the same by the time you're actually applying for a mortgage. Plus it's subject to change based on things that have nothing to do with you.

- Which mortgage lender is the best?The answer depends on your needs. Mortgage lenders vary by the types of loans and services they offer as well as their credit score minimums and other requirements for borrowers. The best mortgage lender is the one that offers the products you need, has requirements you can meet and charges the lowest mortgage rates and fees.

- How do I find the lender with the lowest mortgage rate?Some lenders post mortgage rates on their websites and include tools to see how much your rate might be. But those are just estimates. You'll need to get preapproved for a mortgage to get a rate offer based on your credit score and other financial information.

- How much are closing costs?Closing costs are the various fees and expenses you pay to finalize the mortgage. Closing costs typically run between about 2% and 5% of the loan amount. That means on a $300,000 home loan, you could pay $6,000 to $15,000 in closing costs.

- What if I can't afford closing costs?Most state housing finance agencies offer first-time home buyer programs, which can include closing cost and down payment assistance. The assistance can come in the form of a grant, a forgivable loan or a deferred-payment loan. To qualify, you need to work with a lender approved by the state agency.

- Should I shop for a home or find a lender first?You should shop for a lender first and get preapproved for a mortgage before shopping for a house. A mortgage preapproval shows sellers and their real estate agents that you're a serious buyer. It also indicates how much you can borrow, which will help you determine how much home you can afford.

Financial Tips:
- To ensure you get the best loan possible, take time to shop rates with multiple lenders and compare.
- How to compare auto loan rates and lenders
- Many factors determine the auto loan rate you’re offered, the monthly payment and even whether your auto loan is approved. However, auto lenders often use this criteria differently, so the rate and payment you’re offered from lender to lender can vary greatly. That’s why it’s a good idea to compare lenders to find your best auto loan.
- Your credit and financial situation
- Lenders consider your income, length of employment, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, credit score and other financial factors when approving an auto loan and setting the rate.
- The scoring model a lender uses can also affect whether your loan is approved and at what rate. Credit scores fall within a range of 300 to 850 on two basic scoring models, FICO and VantageScore. Some auto lenders also use industry-specific scoring on top of the basic FICO model when making auto loan decisions.
- Check your credit report: We mentioned that credit history affects your interest rate, so make sure information in your credit report is accurate. If not, dispute any credit errors. You’re entitled to a weekly free copy of your report from each of the major reporting bureaus (Equifax, Experian and TransUnion) at AnnualCreditReport.com.
- Get your credit score: Credit reports from the major reporting bureaus don’t typically show your credit score, but you can often get it for free through your bank or a credit card issuer. NerdWallet offers a free credit score and report, updated weekly using TransUnion data. Knowing your credit score can give you an idea of what interest rate to expect and where to apply, since many lenders have a minimum credit score.
- Find lenders that look beyond credit score: Historically, credit score has been the biggest factor in determining auto loan approval and rate. However, some lenders have expanded underwriting criteria to place greater emphasis on factors like education, meaning borrowers with less than perfect credit may qualify for competitive auto loan rates based on a bigger picture. NerdWallet auto lender reviews include several of these lenders.
- Nerdy Tip
- Car loan interest rates and annual percentage rates, or APRs, aren't the same. Interest rate is the percentage you pay to borrow money. APR includes interest rate plus any fees charged by a lender. When comparing loan offers, make sure you’re comparing the APR.
- Your type of vehicle and loan amount
- You may have your mind set on a certain make and model of car, but it’s worth considering that vehicle choice can influence the interest rate you receive. For example, most lenders charge lower rates for new cars and higher rates for used cars. Typically, loan rates are the highest for cars purchased from a private seller.
- Consider your car choice: This may seem obvious, but if you want to reduce your loan amount or get a lower interest rate, you might need to settle for fewer extra features or a car that's more likely to maintain its resale value.
- Know that lender rate structures can differ: Some lenders, often credit unions, don’t differentiate between new, used or private party car loans, or they’re more flexible about which cars are considered new. So the interest rates they offer for a certain car type might be more competitive.
- Make a down payment: The bigger a car’s price tag and the more you borrow, the greater the risk to the lender which can result in a higher interest rate. You may not be required to put money down, but making a car down payment to reduce your loan amount can help you obtain a better interest rate.
- Your auto loan term
- Term is the amount of time you have to repay a loan, and the most common auto loan terms are 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 and 84 months. Going with a longer-term loan may result in a lower monthly payment, but you’ll pay more in interest over the life of the loan as shown in this example chart.
- Auto loan term
- Based on a $35,000 car loan with a 9% APR and no down payment or trade in.
- » MORE: Understand the impact of terms with our auto loan calculator
- Consider whether a shorter loan term will work: Because car prices have skyrocketed in the past several years, many car buyers are going with longer terms to lower their monthly payment. But these longer-term loans often come with higher interest rates. NerdWallet recommends limiting new car loans to 60 months and used car loans to 36 months when possible.
- Pay attention to term when comparing loan offers: Sometimes lenders will stretch out the loan term to arrive at a lower monthly payment. Make sure any loans you’re comparing have the same term, because simply going with the lowest payment can cost you much more in interest overall.
- Average auto loan rates by credit score
- As noted above, many factors go into determining your auto loan’s APR, and rates vary from applicant to applicant. But knowing averages for auto loan rates can give you a benchmark for comparison to your own loan offers.
- In the fourth quarter of 2024, the overall average auto loan interest rates were 6.35% for new cars and 11.62% for used cars. This is according to consumer credit reporting company Experian in its quarterly Automotive Finance Market report.
- Experian also breaks down average car loan APRs by credit score, based on the VantageScore credit scoring model. The table below gives you an idea of the interest rate you might expect for your credit score range for both new and used car loans.
- Current state of auto loan interest rates
- Credit score
- People with credit scores above 780 have the best shot of getting the lowest interest rates, with credit scores below 501 typically resulting in the highest interest rates.
- Some sources provide average auto loan interest rates on a monthly basis, but they aren’t broken down by credit score. In March 2025, automotive site Edmunds.com listed the average car loan interest rate for February 2025 as 7.2% APR for new car loans and 11.3% APR for used car loans. Data company Cox Automotive gave the volume-weighted average rate as 9.69% for new cars and 14.73% for used cars in its March 4, 2025, Auto Market Report. Cox Automotive rates are sales-weighted averages based on information from Dealertrack, a software used by auto dealerships.
- Are current auto loan rates rising or falling?
- When the Federal Reserve changes the federal funds rate, auto loan interest rates tend to march in the same direction, even though the two aren’t directly linked. Fed rate hikes that began in 2022 have now pushed car loan interest rates to their highest level in years. Below is a chart showing the recent movements of the federal funds rate:
- When you know your credit score, car loan interest rate, loan term and loan amount, you can input this information into an auto loan calculator to estimate a monthly car payment. If you don’t have this information for your specific situation, Experian averages provide some insight into the recent car-financing market:
- Loan amount
- Loan term
- Credit score
- Auto loan averages can be helpful research tools, but you won’t know your specific interest rate or payment amount until you receive lender offers. Auto loan pre-qualification or preapproval can help you gather information to compare and find the best auto loan. You can see which lender has the most competitive rates, offers a repayment option that works for you and is transparent about any fees and other loan details.
- Pre-qualification usually requires only a limited amount of information to get an estimate of how much you qualify to borrow and at what interest rate. Often, you’ll see different options for terms and payments. Many lenders do only a soft credit inquiry for pre-qualification, which won’t affect your credit scores, but the original loan offer could change as you provide additional information.
- Preapproval usually requires you to provide more personal information, such as a Social Security number, in the beginning. It’s a conditional approval of credit, pending verification of your information, and typically carries more weight than pre-qualification. It’s usually done with a hard credit inquiry, which temporarily lowers your credit scores. If you’re buying from a dealership, presenting a preapproved loan offer from another lender gives the dealership a rate to beat.
- Types of auto loans
- While this article focuses on financing for new and used cars, there are other types of auto loans you might want to be aware of.
- New car purchase loans enable you to borrow money to buy a new car and pay it off over time. Lenders usually define a new car as one that has never been titled and is the current or previous model year.
- Used or pre-owned cars are usually defined by lenders as being older than the previous model year. Loans for used cars may come with certain restrictions, such as maximum mileage or vehicle age. These loans can help you pay for a used car you buy from a dealer, from an online car retailer or from a private party.
- Lenders that offer private-party auto loans
- Lenders that offer private-party auto loans
- Auto refinancing loans enable you to replace your current auto loan with a new one, usually from another lender. You may want to refinance if you think you could now qualify for a lower interest rate. Refinancing a car loan can be a way to lower your car payment or pay off your loan sooner, saving you money on the total interest you pay.

- Bad-credit auto loans
- First-time car buyer loans can be challenging to get when you have no previous car loan or credit history. But some lenders have more flexible credit requirements to help first-time car buyers qualify, although it's often with a higher interest rate.

Application Process:
- Use the life insurance calculator above to get a more refined idea of how much coverage you need, and then compare that value to these estimates.

Financial Tips:
- Your annual salary multiplied by the number of years you want to replace that income.
- Your annual salary multiplied by the number of years you want to replace that income.
- Your mortgage balance.
- Your mortgage balance.
- Any other debts.
- Any other debts.
- 1. Multiply your income by 10
- The “10 times income” guideline is often shared online, but it doesn’t take a detailed look at your family’s needs, nor does it account for your savings or existing life insurance policies. And it doesn’t provide a coverage amount for stay-at-home parents, who should have insurance even if they don’t make an income.
- 2. Buy 10 times your income, plus $100,000 per child for college expenses
- This formula adds another layer to the "10 times income" rule by including additional coverage for your child’s education. College and other education expenses are an important component of your life insurance calculation if you have kids. However, this method still doesn’t take a deep look at all of your family’s needs, assets or life insurance coverage already in place.
- This formula encourages you to take a more detailed look at your finances than the other two. DIME stands for debt, income, mortgage and education, four areas that you should account for when calculating your life insurance needs.
- Debt and final expenses: Add up your debts, other than your mortgage, plus an estimate of your funeral expenses.
- Debt and final expenses: Add up your debts, other than your mortgage, plus an estimate of your funeral expenses.

- Mortgage: Calculate the amount you need to pay off your mortgage.
- Mortgage: Calculate the amount you need to pay off your mortgage.
- 4. Replace your income, plus add a cushion
- With this method, you’ll buy enough coverage that your beneficiaries can replace your income without spending the payout itself. Instead, they can save or invest the lump sum and use the resulting income to pay expenses.
- To calculate the amount, divide your annual income by a conservative rate of return, such as 4% or 5%. As an example, let’s assume your income is $50,000 and you estimate a 5% rate of return. The math works like this: $50,000 divided by 5% equals $1 million. So if you buy a million-dollar life insurance policy and your beneficiaries put the payout into a bank account earning 5% annual interest, they can expect to generate $50,000 a year to replace your income.
- When your dependents no longer need the income to meet daily living expenses, the $1 million can go toward other goals such as college tuition, home buying or retirement income.
- To use this method for a stay-at-home parent, first add up how much it would cost each year to pay someone else to handle that parent’s tasks. Then plug that number into the formula as if it were the stay-at-home parent’s annual income.
- Tips for calculating how much life insurance you need
- Keep these tips in mind as you calculate your coverage needs:
- Think of life insurance as part of your overall financial plan. That plan should take into account future expenses, such as college costs, and the future growth of your income or assets.
- Think of life insurance as part of your overall financial plan. That plan should take into account future expenses, such as college costs, and the future growth of your income or assets.
- Don’t skimp. Your income likely will rise over the years, and so will your expenses. While you can’t anticipate exactly how much either of these will increase, a cushion helps make sure your spouse and kids can maintain their lifestyle.
- Don’t skimp. Your income likely will rise over the years, and so will your expenses. While you can’t anticipate exactly how much either of these will increase, a cushion helps make sure your spouse and kids can maintain their lifestyle.
- Talk the numbers through with your family. How much money does your spouse think the family would need to carry on without you? Do your estimates make sense to them? For example, would your family need to replace your full income or just a portion?
- Talk the numbers through with your family. How much money does your spouse think the family would need to carry on without you? Do your estimates make sense to them? For example, would your family need to replace your full income or just a portion?
- Consider buying multiple, smaller life insurance policies. You can buy more than one life insurance policy to vary your coverage as your needs ebb and flow. For instance, you could buy a 30-year term life insurance policy to cover your spouse until your retirement and a 20-year term policy to cover your children until they graduate from college. Compare life insurance quotes to estimate your costs.
- Consider buying multiple, smaller life insurance policies. You can buy more than one life insurance policy to vary your coverage as your needs ebb and flow. For instance, you could buy a 30-year term life insurance policy to cover your spouse until your retirement and a 20-year term policy to cover your children until they graduate from college. Compare life insurance quotes to estimate your costs.
- Term life insurance lasts for a set period of time, such as 10, 20 or 30 years. So, when calculating coverage, think about how long you want your term policy to last. For example, if you need life insurance to cover your income until your kids go to college, you may need a 20-year policy. Alternatively, if you want to cover your mortgage, you may need a 30-year term policy.

- You’ll also want to include detailed financial projections, budgets and thorough explanations of how you plan to spend investor dollars or loans. Since cash flow projections will fluctuate as you adjust projected income and expenses, it helps to think of the plan’s financials as a living, changing document.
- Set aside time early on to find out what licenses and permits you need before you can open your doors. While you don’t typically need a lawyer to apply for a business license, they can help you navigate the process and review other documents, like lease agreements or loans, before you sign them. Industry associations, city officials who work on economic development issues and local business associations, like your Chamber of Commerce, may be able to offer advice, too.
- Keeping your business and personal finances separate is key to managing your business finances. It’s standard bookkeeping hygiene and makes it easier to deduct business expenses come tax time. Opening a business bank account is easy and often free.
- Most businesses need a little capital to get started. However, the majority of business loans are not available to businesses that have been operating for less than six months, and most online lenders prefer at least a year in business. Startups should consider alternative financing options, or try to leverage other strengths of their business, such as strong credit or collateral. If your business does qualify for a loan, be sure to pay attention to interest rates, potential prepayment fees and personal liability terms.
- Many business owners rely on their own savings to get started. You can also look into crowdfunding, personal loans, business grants and more. High-growth-potential startups may also be eligible for equity financing, which gives partial ownership, or equity, to investors in exchange for capital.

Financial Tips:
- Nerdy Tip
- The Fed lowered its benchmark rate multiple times in the second half of 2024. Saving in a high-yield account means you can still earn some of the best rates around, even if APYs start falling.
- LendingClub LevelUp Savings
- Earn up to $300 with direct deposit. Terms apply.
- The well-known credit card company offers a savings account with a competitive yield, a $0 monthly fee and $0 minimum balance requirement to open the account and a $0 minimum to start earning interest.
- If you like to earn interest on all your deposit balances, the bank also offers a competitive rewards checking account. That checking account is available only to consumers who have an American Express credit card. If you’re already a credit card consumer, or plan to be, this bank offers a complete package with its checking and savings options. If you’re only interested in savings, the high-yield savings account is still worth considering.
- The Openbank Savings account is an online high-yield savings option that has no monthly fees. You’ll need at least $500 to open an account, and it is not available to existing Santander Bank customers. It is also not available to those within Santander Bank’s footprint. This includes those with home zip codes in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. If these restrictions don’t apply to you, this online savings account is worth a look.
- Requirements to qualify
- This savings account does not charge monthly fees, and there is no minimum balance required to the earn the 3.90% APY. You'll be able to access your account through multiple options, such as mobile app and desktop. Be advised that the bank doesn’t offer a checking account.
- When selecting the best high-yield savings accounts, NerdWallet uses multiple data points, including monthly fees, minimum balance requirements, APY, mobile app ratings and customer service availability. Click the financial institution’s name in the table below to read a full review.
- The Fed kept the federal funds rate steady for over a year — from mid-2023 through the second half of 2024 — in an effort to tame inflation. In the second half of 2024, after a period of decreasing inflation rates, the Fed announced multiple rate cuts, which led to decreases in some savings account yields. More recently, the Fed has kept the target rate range steady. Going forward, we may see more savings rate dips, but it’s unlikely we’ll see steep drops.
- Be willing to look beyond the larger, well-known banks. Many smaller institutions — including online banks and apps — feature good rates and low deposit requirements.
- With online banking, you can access your account securely day or night. Online banks, credit unions and nonbank providers offer some of the best savings rates on the market while charging fewer fees than traditional banks. They also often offer good websites and mobile apps that typically let customers deposit checks and pay bills.
- Occasionally, your application to open an account may not be approved. This is likely because of issues with your previous banking history.
- In short, yes. High-yield savings accounts at banks and credit unions are federally insured up to $250,000 per depositor, and many nonbank providers partner with banks for insurance. Accounts at banks are backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., while credit union accounts are backed by the National Credit Union Administration. This means that even if the financial institution fails, the government makes sure your money is safe and accessible. Read NerdWallet's primer on FDIC insurance to learn more.
- When we describe a savings account that is offered by a bank, we note “Member FDIC,” since the bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the account is federally insured. If a financial technology company — not a bank — offers a savings account, it typically partners with a bank that is an FDIC member to hold the funds so deposits can be insured. In those cases, we note “funds insured by the FDIC.” Savings accounts at credit unions are federally insured by the National Credit Union Administration, so we note “funds insured by the NCUA.”
- Having multiple savings accounts can be helpful in organizing separate savings goals. For example, you could open one savings account to cover emergencies and another to save for your next vacation.
- The interest you earn in a savings account is generally taxable, according to the Internal Revenue Service. Near the beginning of the calendar year, in time to file your taxes, your financial institution may send you a form 1099-INT reporting if you earned more than $10 in interest the previous year. When you receive this form, be sure to check it against your own bank account records for accuracy. Even if you don’t receive this tax form, the IRS states that the interest you earn in any amount is taxable. Be sure to check with a tax advisor to know your reporting requirements.
- The banks we have surveyed don't have rates as high as 7%, though some have rates north of 4%. When we analyze banks for this list, we look at a number of factors, including minimum balance requirements and monthly fees. Our full editorial list provides several options that earn high rates and offer a solid banking experience.
- Nerdy Tip
- If a savings account has a high introductory rate, or short-term high APY from a referral code, but pays a lower yield long term, you may be better off choosing a higher-yield account in the first place. You can use an interest calculator to calculate how much you can earn over a period of years.
- LendingClub, Member FDIC.

- What is a cash-back business credit card?
- Some offer flat-rate rewards. These cards pay a set percentage back on every purchase, no matter what it is. For instance, the Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card pays 1.5% cash back. If you spent $10,000 per month on that credit card, you’d get $150 back each month.
- Rewards can have caps. Most flat-rate cards offer unlimited cash back, but The American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card limits its 2% rate: Earn 2% cash back on all eligible purchases on up to $50,000 per calendar year, then 1%. Cash back earned is automatically credited to your statement. Terms Apply. So if you spend $100,000 on that card, you’ll earn $1,500 cash back in total — $1,000 on the first $50,000 and then $500 after that.
- Bonus categories can have caps, too. The U.S. Bank Triple Cash Rewards Visa® Business Card is an anomaly; most cash with bonus categories cap how much you can earn. Take the Ink Business Cash® Credit Card, for example: Earn 5% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on internet, cable and phone services each account anniversary year, Earn 2% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at gas stations and restaurants each account anniversary year, Earn 1% cash back on all other card purchases with no limit to the amount you can earn. After you’ve spent $25,000, your rewards rate on those bonus categories drops to 1% — the rate you earn on all other spending.
- Getting statement credit. This option applies your rewards to your statement balance, reducing the amount you owe.
- Redeeming for other rewards through your credit card’s portal. You may have the option to use your cash-back rewards to pay for travel or other special rewards, like gift cards, through your credit card issuer’s website. Sometimes rewards go further when you redeem them this way, though the rules vary by credit card issuer.

Application Process:
- Next steps: How to lower your student loan payments
- If you have unsubsidized or private student loans, you can lower the amount you’ll repay by making monthly interest payments while still in school. Or, you may opt for a lump sum payment of the total interest that accrued before repayment begins. Either choice will result in a smaller student loan bill.
- You can pay more than your minimum each month to pay off your student loans faster. The quicker you finish paying off your debt, the more you’ll save in interest.
- » LEARN: How to pay off your student loans faster
- If you’re having trouble managing the monthly bills for your federal loans, you can extend the term to 20 or 25 years with an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan. IDR plans lower your monthly loan payments based on your earnings, but they may increase the total interest that accrues during the life of your loan. Your remaining debt is forgiven after your 20- or 25-year repayment term.
- Private lenders may allow you to temporarily lower monthly bills. To permanently lower private student loan payments, you’ll need to refinance your student loans. By doing so, you replace your current loan or loans with a new, private loan — ideally at a lower interest rate. You’ll need a credit score in the high 600s and steady income (or a co-signer with these qualifications) to get the lowest advertised rates.

- What is a 30-year mortgage?
- A 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is a home loan designed to be paid off in 30 years. It provides the security of a consistent principal and interest payment, and the flexibility to afford a larger mortgage loan because the payments are lower than for a shorter-term mortgage for the same amount.
- Pros and cons of a 30-year fixed mortgage
- The 30-year fixed mortgage is the most popular term of home loan. It meets the needs of many borrowers, but some people prefer shorter loan terms. Here are benefits and drawbacks of the 30-year mortgage:
- Lower payments. Because they’re spread out over 30 years, the monthly payments on a 30-year fixed mortgage are lower than for loans with shorter terms.
- Lower payments. Because they’re spread out over 30 years, the monthly payments on a 30-year fixed mortgage are lower than for loans with shorter terms.
- Flexibility. If your monthly budget allows, you can make extra payments to pay off the loan faster. When money is tight, you can make the minimum payments.
- Flexibility. If your monthly budget allows, you can make extra payments to pay off the loan faster. When money is tight, you can make the minimum payments.
- Predictability. Because it’s a fixed rate, the monthly principal and interest payments are the same over the life of the loan. Property taxes and insurance can change over time, though.

- How to find 30-year mortgage rates today
- Today's mortgage rates can be found via NerdWallet’s mortgage rate tool at the top of this page. It can help you find 30-year fixed mortgage rates today that are tailored to meet your needs. In the filters above, enter details about the loan you’re looking for, and you can see an interest rate quote without providing personal information.
- 30-year mortgage rates vary over time and by lender
- 30-year mortgage rates vary day to day and even hour by hour. You can save money by comparison shopping because each lender offers its own combination of interest rate and fees. The loan offer with the lowest interest rate isn't necessarily the best. Lenders charge fees to offset expenses and add to their bottom lines. These closing costs can vary a lot from one lender to another, and they aren't necessarily spelled out until you formally apply for a loan.
- How to compare mortgage offers
- If you’re approved, each lender will provide you with a Loan Estimate form. This will let you compare interest rates, origination fees and closing costs, giving you confidence that you’re getting the right loan for your situation
- The Loan Estimate is a three-page document that provides the loan's details, projected payments and closing costs. Page 3 of the Loan Estimate has a section labeled "Comparisons." It's designed to simplify comparing loan offers. It provides three subheadings:
- "In 5 Years" totals how much you would spend on the mortgage in its first five years, including closing costs, principal, interest and mortgage insurance. A lower number is better.
- "In 5 Years" totals how much you would spend on the mortgage in its first five years, including closing costs, principal, interest and mortgage insurance. A lower number is better.

Financial Tips:
- "Total Interest Percentage (TIP)" measures the total interest you would pay as a percentage of the loan amount. A lower TIP is better.
- "Total Interest Percentage (TIP)" measures the total interest you would pay as a percentage of the loan amount. A lower TIP is better.
- A Freddie Mac report concluded that a typical borrower can expect to save $600 to $1,200 annually by comparison-shopping four lenders instead of applying with just one lender.
- How mortgage rates are set
- Mortgage rates are determined by market forces: Bad economic or global political worries can move mortgage rates lower. Good news can push rates higher.
- Lenders fine-tune your mortgage rate based on risk. The higher your credit score and the bigger your down payment, the lower your mortgage tends to be.

- Show detailsKey factsBrazos is best for parent loan borrowers who live in Texas and want to finance undergraduate or graduate education for their children.ProsBorrowers can finance undergraduate and graduate degree programs.Students do not have to attend college in Texas to qualify. ConsAvailable only to parent borrowers in Texas.QualificationsTypical credit score of approved borrowers: N/AMinimum income: $60,000 for co-signer or primary borrower, or $30,000 for primary borrower if applying with a co-signer.Loan amounts: $10,000 up to $400,000.Available Term Lengths 5, 7, 10, 15, or 20  yearsDisclaimerRates as of 03/01/2025. Lowest variable rate assumes a current Thirty-day Average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) of % plus a 2.03% margin minus the 0.25% Auto-Pay Discount. If approved for a Brazos loan, the fixed or variable interest rate offered will depend on your creditworthiness, the term of the loan and other factors, and will be within the ranges of rates listed above. For the Brazos variable rate loan, the Thirty-day Average SOFR index will adjust monthly and the loan payment will be re-amortized and may change monthly. APRs for variable rate loans may increase after origination if the SOFR index increases. Auto-Pay Discount. The interest rate in effect will be reduced by 0.25% if either the borrower or the cosigner authorizes automated (ACH) payments from any bank account. This ACH interest rate reduction, referred to as the Auto-Pay Discount, applies only when full principal and interest payments are automatically drafted from a bank account. This interest rate reduction will not continue to apply during periods of approved forbearance or deferment. The Auto-Pay Discount will terminate if the automatic bank account payments discontinue or there are any three instances of insufficient funds at any time during the term of the loan. A borrower may requalify upon reauthorization of automatic payments from a valid bank account.This means that your payment may increase, or decrease, after disbursement. The variable rate is capped and will never exceed 9.90%. The rate is expressed as an APR. Since there are no fees associated with this loan, the APR is the same as the actual interest rate for the loan. While the APR, once you proceed, may differ slightly depending upon the calculation methods and certain assumptions, the base rate and margin that you are charged will remain as stated. Auto-Pay Discount includes a .25% interest rate reduction when either the borrower or cosigner authorizes ACH payments of full principal and interest from any bank account. Certain other terms and conditions apply.Read Full Review

- Choosing the best credit card for you in 2025
- If you're a beginner to credit cards, see our step-by-step guide to choosing a credit card. It starts by helping you figure out what cards you can qualify for, then walks you through deciding what kind of card best fits your needs. The process in short:
- The higher your credit score, the more likely you are to qualify for the best credit cards of 2025. NerdWallet offers free access to credit scores.
- If your credit score needs work, get a card designed for building or mending credit. Otherwise, choose between a card that will give you rewards for your spending or one that will save you money on interest.
- Comparing credit card features
- Every credit card delivers value in its own way, through its own unique combination of features. And there are trade-offs involved. If you want rewards, for example, you'll probably have to accept a higher interest rate. If you want high-value perks, you'll likely pay an annual fee. If you want a low interest rate and no fees, you shouldn't expect much else from the card. In other words, you're unlikely to find a single card that offers a high rewards rate, a long 0% period, a rock-bottom ongoing interest rate, generous perks and no annual fee.
- Here are the main points of comparison when looking at credit cards.
- Some people are dead-set against paying a fee just for the privilege of carrying a credit card. But paying an annual fee is worth it in certain circumstances. With any annual fee, the math comes down to whether the value you get from the card exceeds the dollar amount you pay. Still determined not to pay? See our best credit cards with no annual fee of 2025.
- Balance transfer fee. See our best credit cards with no balance transfer fee of 2025.

- Foreign transaction fee. See our best credit cards with no foreign transaction fee of 2025.
- Foreign transaction fee. See our best credit cards with no foreign transaction fee of 2025.
- Cash advance fee. Using your credit card to get cash is expensive.
- Cash advance fee. Using your credit card to get cash is expensive.
- Credit card companies drum up business by offering people with good credit a low introductory interest rate.
- The ongoing rate is what you pay after any introductory rate expires. Some cards charge a single rate for all cardholders; others allow for a range of rates depending on your creditworthiness. In general, the better your credit, the more likely you are to qualify for a low rate. That said, if you pay your balance in full every month, your interest rate doesn't actually matter because you're never charged interest.
- The sign-up bonus or welcome offer is a sum of cash (say, $150 or $200) or a batch of points or miles (say, 40,000 points or 50,000 miles) that you can earn by spending a certain amount of money in your first few months with a card. The purpose is to get you in the habit of using the card. The bonuses on many travel cards are often big enough to cover the card's annual fee for the first few years. See our best credit card sign-up bonuses of 2025.
- Unlike rewards, which are what you receive for using a credit card, perks are benefits you get just for carrying a card. With some cards, particularly travel credit cards, it may be the perks that provide the bulk of the value. Premium credit cards, which have annual fees of $450 and up, tend to offer the cushiest perks. Airline credit cards and hotel credit cards can easily pay for their annual fee with their perks. A full list of potential perks would be too long to include here, but common examples include:
- Statement credits. Automatic credit for such things as travel expenses, purchases from selected merchants or the application fee for trusted traveler programs such as TSA PreCheck and Global Entry.

Financial Tips:
- Many credit card users carry multiple cards with bonus rewards in different categories, plus a flat-rate card for purchases that fall outside those categories.
- » MORE: Cash back vs. travel — how to choose credit card rewards
- Different types of credit cards
- Credit card companies in 2025 offer different kinds of cards to meet different consumer needs. Some people put a lot of money on their cards every month and then pay them off immediately; those people benefit from a card that returns a portion of their spending in the form of rewards. Others tend to carry a balance from month to month; they're better served with a card that offers a low ongoing interest rate. Still others are working to improve their credit; issuers have cards designed for those people, too.
- Rewards credit cards
- These cards "pay you back" for a portion of your spending by giving you cash, points or miles. See our roundup of the best rewards credit cards of 2025 for a range of options for different types of users. Or look into specific types of rewards cards:

- Best hotel credit cards of 2025.

- Interest-saving credit cards
- These cards offer an introductory 0% APR period or a low ongoing interest rate. That can save you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in interest on a major purchase or on debt transferred from high-interest cards. Types of interest-saving cards include:
- Best balance transfer credit cards of 2025.

- Best low-interest credit cards of 2025.
- Best low-interest credit cards of 2025.
- Credit-building credit cards
- You don't need to have multiple cards to maintain good credit score. Credit scoring formulas tend to reward you for having different types of accounts — credit cards, mortgages, loans, etc. — but it's not necessary to have multiple accounts of each type. One credit card, responsibly managed, is enough.

- Advantages of carrying multiple cards
- One card may pay you a higher rewards rate on groceries. Another may reward you handsomely at restaurants, or on gas purchases, or for spending on travel. Having multiple cards allows you to maximize your total rewards.
- A key factor in your credit score is your credit utilization, or how much of your available credit you're using. Ideally, you’ll want to keep utilization below 30%. If you have a $500 balance on a card with a $1,000 limit, your utilization is 50%. If you have $500 in balances spread across three cards with limits of $1,000 each, your utilization about is 17%.
- Risks of carrying multiple cards
- Multiple due dates increase the risk of missing a payment, which can trigger a late fee or (if it's late enough) even damage your credit.
- NerdWallet's Credit Cards content team selected the best credit cards of 2025 in each category based on overall consumer value, as evidenced by star ratings, as well as their suitability for specific kinds of consumers. This page includes selections across multiple categories, and a single card is eligible to be chosen as among the "best" in more than one category. Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards. Factors in our evaluations include:
- For credit-building cards
- For credit-building cards
- What's the best credit card?
- No single credit card is the best for everyone. It all depends on how you use credit and how strong your credit is.
- A rewards credit card gives you a little something back with each purchase you make — usually cash back or travel points or airline miles. These cards are best for people who can pay their credit card bill in full each month. If you carry a balance from one month to the next, the interest you pay will eat up the value of your rewards.
- A zero percent credit card is ideal if you're looking to finance a big purchase or pay down high-interest debt by way of a balance transfer. If you tend to carry a balance month to month, look for a card with low ongoing interest rate.
- A credit-building card is designed for people who are just starting out with credit or are trying to bounce back from damaged credit. Rewards cards and zero-percent cards are available mostly to people with good to excellent credit; for those who aren't there yet, there are credit-building cards. There are options for bad credit, for fair or average credit and for people with no credit history.
- What's the easiest credit card to get?
- Secured credit cards require you to provide a cash security deposit to open an account. Because that deposit protects the card company from risk, secured cards are much easier to qualify for than other cards. You're not guaranteed approval for a secured card, but the bar is much lower than for regular cards. Store credit cards are also generally easier to qualify for than bank cards.
- What's the best credit card company?
- Just as there is no single best card for everyone, consumers have widely different opinions about the best (and worst) credit card issuers. One person could get the runaround from customer service rep and rate a bank zero stars as a result, while another has nothing but positive experiences and gives it five stars across the board. Still, some trends emerge in customer satisfaction surveys.
- J.D. Power conducts an annual study of satisfaction among major national and regional credit card issuers. It regularly rates Discover and American Express at the top among mass-market issuers. In the most recent study, USAA and Navy Federal Credit Union had the highest ratings of all, but keep in mind that only people affiliated with the military are eligible for USAA or Navy Federal products.

Eligibility Criteria:
- Eligibility age: The earliest age at which a person can begin taking Social Security retirement benefits. Typically this is age 62. The eligibility age is not the same as the full retirement age. Taking Social Security benefits before full retirement age typically results in a smaller monthly check.

Application Process:
- Calculating your Social Security retirement benefit — a crucial source of income for many retirees — can be an important step in choosing when to retire (signing up for and choosing a Medicare plan is another).
- How to use this Social Security calculator
- Enter your date of birth. The Social Security Administration uses your date of birth to determine when you're eligible for 100% of your retirement benefits, among other things.
- Enter your date of birth. The Social Security Administration uses your date of birth to determine when you're eligible for 100% of your retirement benefits, among other things.

- Enter your current annual income. This helps us estimate your past and future earnings.
- How the Social Security calculator works
- Three things greatly influence the size of your Social Security retirement benefits: your highest 35 years of earnings, when you were born and when you decide to start taking benefits. This Social Security benefits calculator accounts for those three things.
- The math to calculate Social Security retirement benefits is complex, and the calculator also incorporates the following data from the Social Security Administration:
- The set percentages by which the SSA decreases or increases a person's benefits depending on their birth year and when they apply for retirement benefits.
- The set percentages by which the SSA decreases or increases a person's benefits depending on their birth year and when they apply for retirement benefits.

Application Process:
- It's a good idea to estimate closing costs early in the homebuying process so you can budget for them along with a down payment.
- After you've applied for a mortgage, the lender will provide two official notices of your loan’s closing costs:
- The Loan Estimate provides details about your loan, including the projected monthly mortgage payment and estimated closing costs. A lender must provide a Loan Estimate within three business days after you apply for a mortgage.
- The Loan Estimate provides details about your loan, including the projected monthly mortgage payment and estimated closing costs. A lender must provide a Loan Estimate within three business days after you apply for a mortgage.
- Closing costs include loan and service fees, taxes, government fees and insurance premiums.
- Loan origination charges are fees the lender charges to underwrite and process your loan.
- Loan origination charges are fees the lender charges to underwrite and process your loan.
- Discount points are optional upfront payments you make to lower the interest rate. One discount point equals 1% of the loan amount and typically lowers the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
- Discount points are optional upfront payments you make to lower the interest rate. One discount point equals 1% of the loan amount and typically lowers the interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point.
- Prepaid interest covers the amount of interest that will accrue on the mortgage between the date of settlement and the first monthly payment due date.
- Prepaid interest covers the amount of interest that will accrue on the mortgage between the date of settlement and the first monthly payment due date.
- Initial escrow payments include deposits to start your escrow account, which will be used to cover property taxes, home insurance and, if applicable, private mortgage insurance. Typically, you'll deposit enough money to cover two months of these costs.
- Initial escrow payments include deposits to start your escrow account, which will be used to cover property taxes, home insurance and, if applicable, private mortgage insurance. Typically, you'll deposit enough money to cover two months of these costs.
- No-closing-cost mortgages
- Your closing costs can be included in the mortgage. This is known as a no-closing cost mortgage.
- The pro: You avoid paying more upfront at loan closing in addition to your down payment.
- The con: Your monthly payment is higher, as is the overall cost of your home loan.
- How it works: Your lender pays your closing costs in exchange for either charging you a higher interest rate or adding the fees into your loan amount, or both.

Financial Tips:
- Nerdy Tip
- What if you’ve gotten a cash-out refinance before, but want to do it again? Most loans have a waiting, or “seasoning,” requirement of at least six months. Within that guideline, you can refinance as often as you want — but you’ll pay closing costs each time.
- Home equity loans or lines of credit are alternatives for tapping a portion of home equity without refinancing your entire mortgage.
- Pros and cons of a cash-out refinance
- Simple repayment: One loan, one bill to remember
- Access more funds at a lower rate than with a personal loan or credit card
- Closing costs run 2%-6% of the new loan amount
- Alternatives to a cash-out refinance
- A cash-out refinance isn't the only way to tap your home's equity. You can also explore a HELOC or a home equity loan.
- A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, works like a credit card, but is secured by your home. You’re able to borrow up to a certain limit, repay some or all of what you took out, then do it again as needed. The lender uses your home’s value to set the HELOC limit.
- Home equity loans
- If you know exactly how much you need to borrow, you might consider a home equity loan, which you receive as a lump sum and pay back at a fixed rate.
- Home equity loan rates are generally higher than cash-out refinance interest rates, but you can keep your existing rate on your primary mortgage.

Financial Tips:
- Some people like to juggle multiple credit cards, with a specific card for every major category of spending. Others prefer the simplicity of having one card for everything. If that's you, consider one of these cards that pay a solid rate on everything:
- Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card: 1.5% cash back on all purchases (see rates and fees). Bonus offer: Earn a one-time $200 cash bonus after you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months from account opening.
- Capital One Quicksilver Cash Rewards Credit Card: 1.5% cash back on all purchases (see rates and fees). Bonus offer: Earn a one-time $200 cash bonus after you spend $500 on purchases within 3 months from account opening.
- Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card: 1.5% cash back on all purchases. Bonus offer: $200 online cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of your account opening.
- Bank of America® Unlimited Cash Rewards credit card: 1.5% cash back on all purchases. Bonus offer: $200 online cash rewards bonus after making at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of your account opening.
- Branded credit cards
- If you buy your groceries wholesale-club-style, the Costco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi earns 2% cash back at Costco and Costco.com. It also earns 4% cash back on eligible gas and EV charging purchases (both at Costco and at other gas stations) on the first $7,000 per year (1% thereafter), as well as 3% cash back on restaurants and eligible travel purchases. All other spending earns 1% back. The annual fee is $0, although you have to be a Costco member to apply, and membership starts at $65 a year. » Rewards on $5,000 a year in groceries at Costco: $100.
- The Target Circle™ Credit Card doesn't offer rewards in the form of cash back or points, but you could argue that it gives you something even better: an immediate 5% discount on nearly everything you buy at Target, either in-store or online. You also get free shipping on most items at Target.com. If your grocery runs take you to a full-service Super Target — or just to the food aisles at a regular Target — this  $0-annual-fee card is mighty attractive. » Savings on $5,000 a year in groceries at Target: $250.
- NerdWallet's credit cards team selects the best credit cards in each category based on overall consumer value. Factors in our evaluation include fees, promotional and ongoing APRs, and sign-up bonuses; for rewards cards, we consider earning and redemption rates, redemption options and redemption difficulty. A single card is eligible to be chosen as among the "best" in multiple categories. Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards.

Application Process:
- For a smooth shopping process, follow these five steps when you’re ready to compare car insurance.
- If you already have a policy you’re happy with, grab your most recent car insurance declaration page and refer to it when choosing the coverage amounts for each quote.
- If you’re new to auto insurance or unsure whether your current limits are right for you, check out our guide to how much car insurance coverage you need.

Financial Tips:
- Car insurance costs vary substantially — from one company to the next and from one driver to the next. That’s because each insurer uniquely calculates car insurance rates using many personal factors, like your age, marital status and driving history. You can find the best rate for you by comparing quotes from multiple companies.
- Requires making multiple phone calls or entering your information over and over again.
- Another option is to shop with multiple companies at once using a comparison website. (Fun fact: NerdWallet offers its own comparison tool you can try.)
- A final option is to work with an independent insurance agent or insurance broker. This is often a local professional who will take your information by phone or in person, then shop around for insurance on your behalf. An agent or broker may be a good fit for people with complicated insurance needs — if you have a spotty driving history, for example, or you’re trying to get quotes for multiple cars, a house and an umbrella policy for extra liability coverage.
- Once you move forward with purchasing the policy, the insurer will dig deeper into who you are and look at things like your driving history and insurance-credit score to calculate the actual price you will pay. This final price is called a premium.
- These are fictionalized quotes for the purposes of illustration.

Application Process:
- Lenders don’t usually divulge their underwriting techniques, but many major banks, credit unions and online lenders offer pre-qualification. This process allows you to check your potential loan amount, rate and repayment term without a hard credit pull.
- A personal loan’s annual percentage rate (APR) represents the cost of the loan and includes the interest rate plus any other fees a lender charges, like an origination fee. Your personal loan interest rate and APR may be the same number if there are no loan fees.
- Because these loans usually don’t require collateral, such as a house or car, your personal loan rate depends heavily on your credit and financial information.
- A good personal loan rate is the lowest one you qualify for. APRs are typically between 6% and 36%, which is a wide range compared to other types of loans like mortgages and auto loans. Because rates can vary widely, it’s not helpful to compare your rate to someone else’s. Instead, pre-qualify for personal loans with multiple lenders to find the lowest rate and best terms. This process doesn’t require a hard credit pull, so it’s a low-risk way to determine which lender could offer you the best rate.
- APR and interest rate are so similar they’re often used interchangeably, but on personal loans there’s an important distinction. A personal loan APR includes the interest rate plus any origination fee. According to the Truth in Lending Act, all lenders must disclose a loan’s APR before you sign an agreement.
- If you currently have a personal loan with a high rate, you may be able to lock in a lower rate by refinancing a personal loan, especially if you’ve improved your credit or lowered your debt since you first borrowed. Lenders have different refinancing policies: Some allow borrowers to refinance a personal loan you have with them, but others may require you to refinance with a different lender.
- If you refinance, be mindful of the new loan’s term. Even with a lower rate, a longer repayment term could raise the total interest costs.

- Are current personal loan rates high?
- Though personal loan rates have dipped recently, they are still the highest they’ve been in years. Commercial bank loan rates remain at a high not seen since before the Great Recession, according to Fed data.
- Unlike mortgages, personal loans aren’t directly affected by occasional, incremental changes in the Federal Funds rate, but sustained rate decreases over time could help in lowering personal loan rates.

- Rates are high for most types of financing right now, including credit cards and mortgages. Compare personal loans and alternatives, like 0% APR credit cards and home equity financing, to find the most affordable one.
- Why lenders charge different personal loan rates
- Most personal loans are unsecured and don’t require collateral to secure the loan. Instead, lenders use borrowers’ financial and credit profiles to make approval decisions and determine their rates. Most lenders tailor their APR ranges to the type of borrower they want to attract.
- Lenders that accept good- or excellent-credit borrowers may charge lower rates because those consumers’ credit reports show a strong history of repaying credit cards and other loans. Lenders that target mostly bad-credit consumers, with credit histories showing missed payments, may charge higher rates to make up for the added risk.
- Online lenders: Online lenders often narrow their target borrower pool to a couple of credit segments — fair- and bad-credit borrowers, for example, or good- and excellent-credit borrowers — and price their loans accordingly.
- Banks: Large banks usually work with good-credit borrowers and offer the lowest rates to existing customers because they know how those borrowers manage credit and debt and may see them as less risky.
- Credit unions: Credit unions are an exception: They often accept fair- or bad-credit borrowers but charge relatively low rates. Federal credit unions cap personal loan APRs at 18%. Because they work exclusively with their members, credit unions are able to consider the borrower’s membership history when determining their rate.

- How is your personal loan rate decided?
- Here are four factors that are likely to affect your personal loan rate.
- Credit score: Many lenders set minimum credit score requirements and may publish this information on their websites. This can help you rule out lenders with credit score requirements well above or below yours.

- Payment history: Your repayment history toward other loans and credit cards is a top factor that lenders use to determine your rate. A long history of on-time payments to multiple creditors will work in your favor, while a history of missed and late payments may contribute to a higher rate.

- Debt-to-income ratio (DTI): Your DTI is the percentage of your monthly income that goes toward other debts, such as car, student or mortgage loan payments. Lenders try to avoid providing loans that will overextend borrowers’ budgets, so many like to see a DTI at or below 50%, but lower is better.

- Here are a few questions to ask yourself when deciding whether to get a personal loan, even if you meet the requirements:
- Is a personal loan the right financing option for me? Personal loans can be used to consolidate debt or finance a medical procedure, but you may have lower-cost options, such as a 0% balance transfer credit card or family loan. Compare other ways to borrow money before choosing a personal loan.
- » MORE: Pros and cons of personal loans
- Can I afford the monthly payments? Ideally, the personal loan payments fit comfortably in your budget. Use a personal loan calculator to estimate your monthly payment, and check the results against your budget.
- Do I understand the fees? Some lenders charge origination fees, which can range from 1% to 10% of the loan amount. Late and nonsufficient funds fees are also common. Before applying, understand how the potential fees may affect the loan and your budget.

- If you’re denied for a personal loan, the first step is to understand why. Lenders are required under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to provide the reason for denying a loan application. This information can help you identify the areas where you need to improve your financial or credit profile.
- Next, take steps to strengthen your credit score by paying down debt, resolving errors on your credit report or building more credit history. While this process can take a few months or a year, it can provide the time needed before applying again. It can be difficult to qualify for a loan if you reapply too soon and haven’t built up your credit after being denied.
- Also consider alternatives to a personal loan. Do what you can to build your savings or find a way to earn extra income. If you need to make a purchase, some merchants offer buy now, pay later plans that let you break up a purchase across four to six payments, often without interest.

Financial Tips:

- Personal loans from our partners
- Personal loan requirements
- Credit score
- Your credit score is a key factor lenders consider when evaluating you for a personal loan. A credit score helps lenders understand your reliability as a borrower.
- Many lenders have hard minimum credit score requirements. Some offer loans to borrowers with thin or bad credit (scores from 300 to 629), but people with good or excellent credit scores (690 or higher) typically get the best annual percentage rates and terms.
- Credit history
- Credit history is also a factor on most personal loan applications. Strong applicants have long histories showing on-time payments toward credit cards and other debt.
- You can view your credit reports, which show payment history, for free with NerdWallet or at AnnualCreditReport.com.
- Income
- Lenders want to see that you have steady income or cash flow that can support monthly loan payments. Some lenders have specific minimum monthly or annual income requirements.
- Your paycheck isn’t the only acceptable income source; many lenders accept income from others in your household, alimony and Social Security payments listed on an application.
- Debt-to-income ratio
- Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is the percentage of your monthly income that goes toward debt payments. Lenders use DTI to evaluate your ability to afford new loan payments. While each lender sets its own requirement, they typically look for a DTI below 40%.
- Documents required for a personal loan
- Tips to qualify for a personal loan
- There are a few things that can strengthen your chances of getting approved for a personal loan, even if you don't have a perfect credit score.
- Add a co-signer. Adding a co-signer with strong credit and income can help you qualify for a loan or get a lower interest rate. Keep in mind that a co-signer is responsible for loan payments if you stop making them.

Financial Tips:
- Nerdy Tip
- The Fed lowered its benchmark rate multiple times in the second half of 2024. Saving in a high-yield account means you can still earn some of the best rates around, even if APYs start falling.
- Earn up to $300 with direct deposit. Terms apply.
- If those requirements are not met, your savings balance earns a 1.00% APY. In addition to the savings yield, money kept in the checking portion of the account earns 0.50% APY, regardless of monthly deposits.
- Laurel Road has a savings account that pays a strong rate and has no minimum opening deposit requirements. In addition, there are no monthly fees. Laurel Road also has a checking account that offers monthly cash rewards, so you can do all your banking under one roof.
- » Find out how your savings could add up with NerdWallet’s compound interest calculator.
- You can typically open an account either online or in person. You'll need to provide your Social Security number and contact information (phone number and address), along with at least one form of identification, such as a driver’s license or a passport. If you’re applying for a joint account, the other person must provide this information and ID too.
- Yes, provided your money is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. or the National Credit Union Administration.
- Minimum balance: A minimum balance is the lowest dollar amount you need in a bank account either to avoid fees or satisfy account requirements. The minimum can be an average balance or a fixed amount that’s required either daily or monthly.
- When we describe a savings account that is offered by a bank, we note “Member FDIC,” since the bank is a member of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the account is federally insured. If a financial technology company — not a bank — offers a savings account, it typically partners with a bank that is an FDIC member to hold the funds so deposits can be insured. In those cases, we note “funds insured by the FDIC.” Savings accounts at credit unions are federally insured by the National Credit Union Administration, so we note “funds insured by the NCUA.”
- *Bread Savings™ disclosureBread Savings™ says: All Bread Savings APYs are accurate as of 01/16/2025. APYs are subject to change at any time without notice. Offers apply to personal accounts only. Fees may reduce earnings. For high-yield savings accounts, a minimum of $100 is required and must be deposited in a single transaction. For high-yield savings accounts, the rate may change after the account is opened.

Application Process:
- Debt consolidation is one of the most common reasons borrowers get a Discover personal loan. Discover streamlines the debt consolidation process by sending loan proceeds directly to your creditors, saving you from having to do that step. The lender says it can send funds to creditors in one business day after loan approval.
- Upstart: Best for short credit history
- Even if you have a thin credit file or no credit history, you may be able to qualify for an Upstart personal loan. Instead of relying strongly on a loan applicant’s credit history, Upstart has an AI-based underwriting model that considers alternative data, such as education and work experience, during the loan approval process.
- Upgrade: Best for bad and fair credit
- The minimum credit score for an Upgrade personal loan is 580, which makes it ideal for borrowers with bad or fair credit (scores below 690). Upgrade also offers secured and joint loans, so bad- and fair-credit borrowers can add collateral or a co-borrower to their loan application to boost their chances of approval.
- Best Egg: Best for secured loans
- You can secure a Best Egg personal loan in two ways: with a homeowner-secured loan or with an auto-secured loan. Homeowners can use permanent fixtures in their home, like built-in cabinets or bathroom vanities, as collateral for a secured personal loan. Alternatively, if you own a car, you can pledge your vehicle as collateral.
- Best Egg offers lower annual percentage rates and larger loan amounts for its secured loans. Defaulting on a secured loan, however, means you could lose your collateral.
- LendingClub: Best for joint personal loans
- To strengthen your loan application, you can add a co-borrower with a higher credit score or income when applying for a LendingClub personal loan. With a joint personal loan, both applicants get access to the loan and are responsible for making monthly payments.
- Where to get a personal loan
- Online lenders: Online lenders offer a streamlined loan process and typically provide the fastest funding times. There are online lenders that cater to borrowers across the credit spectrum.
- Banks: Bank lenders typically require borrowers to have good to excellent credit (scores of 690 or higher). Some banks provide rate discounts and perks to existing customers.
- Credit unions: Credit unions are usually more willing to lend to borrowers who have fair or bad credit (scores below 690), but to get a personal loan from a credit union, you must first be a member. Federal credit unions cap interest rates at 18%.
- » MORE: Online vs. in-person loan: Which is better?
- How to compare the best personal loan lenders
- Here are things to consider as you shop for a personal loan.
- Pre-qualification. Many lenders let you pre-qualify online to check your estimated interest rate and loan terms. This process involves a soft credit check, which won’t affect your credit score. It pays to pre-qualify for a loan with multiple lenders and compare offers and loan features.
- Annual percentage rates. Because APRs include interest rates and fees, they provide an apples-to-apples cost comparison for borrowers deciding between personal loan offers. Personal loan interest rates differ by lender, and the rate you receive depends on factors like your credit score, income and debt-to-income ratio (DTI). Use our personal loan calculator to see how APR affects monthly payments and total loan costs.
- » MORE: See average personal loan rates
- Fees: Some lenders charge origination fees to cover the cost of processing the loan. Lenders typically deduct this fee before sending the funds, but it is included in the loan’s annual percentage rate. Some lenders also charge a late fee if you miss a payment’s due date and a nonsufficient funds fee if you authorize a payment but don’t have enough money in your bank account.
- Funding time. The time it takes to get a personal loan can depend on the type of lender. Many online lenders will approve your application and send funds within a day or two after you apply. Banks and credit unions may take up to a week.
- Repayment terms. Lenders may offer a wide variety of repayment terms. They typically range from two to seven years. A shorter-term loan means you’ll pay less interest, while a longer repayment term gives you lower monthly payments. Based on your budget, one may make more financial sense than the other.
- Loan amount. Depending on how much money you need, certain lenders could be a better fit than others. Most lenders offer small to midsize loan amounts of $2,000 to $50,000, but some provide up to $100,000. Determine the amount you need, whether that means adding up your credit card debt to consolidate or getting a cost estimate on a home improvement project, and compare lenders that can offer that size loan.
- "To me, the best personal lender is whichever one charges the least interest on the loan you want. Other factors like flexible payments, a mobile app and fast funding are all nice, but not nice enough to forgo a good rate. You find that lender by pre-qualifying with online lenders and banks until you're satisfied that you've gotten the best possible offer.
- Apply. The formal application process usually requires documents to verify your identity and income. Once approved, you’ll typically receive your loan funds within a week.

- Fixed rates and monthly payments. Personal loans have fixed rates and monthly payments over a set term, so you always know what you owe and for how long. Other financing options like home equity lines of credit have variable rates, meaning the monthly payments fluctuate.
- Flexible loan amounts. Depending on the lender and your creditworthiness, you may have access to personal loan amounts of $1,000 to $100,000. This range meets a wide variety of expenses, from small emergencies to large home improvement projects.
- No collateral. Unlike home equity loans that require you to secure the loan with your house, unsecured personal loans don’t require collateral. You risk hurting your credit if you can’t repay, but you won't lose any assets.

- Maximum APRs can be high. If you have a low credit score, APRs on personal loans can be higher than credit card APRs.
- Possible fees. Borrowers may have to pay fees — like origination or late fees — along with their loan payments.
- Increases debt. Taking a personal loan adds debt to your budget, so it's important to factor in the additional obligation and feel comfortable about paying it off.

- A closer look at the best personal loan lenders
- You can get a personal loan from online lenders, banks and credit unions. The best place to get a personal loan is from a lender that gives you the rate, term and features that fit your financial situation.
- Here’s what makes our picks for the best personal loan lenders stand out:
- SoFi: Best for good to excellent credit
- Although SoFi doesn’t have a specific credit score requirement, the lender told NerdWallet that it caters its loans to good- and excellent-credit borrowers. The average borrower with a SoFi personal loan has a credit score of 745.
- One of the most common reasons borrowers choose a LightStream personal loan is for home improvement. LightStream offers loans of up to $100,000, which can fund expensive remodels or home addition projects. Repayment terms of up to 20 years are available for home improvement loans over $25,000.
- Discover: Best debt consolidation loans
- My biggest tip here is, if your financial institution offers personal loans, pre-qualify or apply with them after you’ve shopped elsewhere. Your bank or credit union is likely to give you the best deal, but you'll only be sure if you’ve already done your research."

- Origination fee: The fee a lender charges when you get the loan to cover processing and administrative costs.

- Cost of loan: The total interest you’ll pay plus the origination fee, which represents the full cost to borrow. This number doesn’t display if you enter a fixed origination fee amount.
- How to compare personal loan costs
- Pay special attention to the monthly payment, total interest costs and interest rate or APR when comparing personal loans.
- Monthly payment: On-time personal loan payments help you build credit, while late and missed payments hurt it. Loan payments should fit comfortably into your monthly budget.
- Total interest payments: Looking at the total interest paid by itself lets you compare the cost of one loan to another. You can also use it as a gut-check to decide if the loan is worth it.
- APR or interest rate: APR represents the cost of borrowing, making it the best apples-to-apples cost comparison tool. A lender is required to disclose this number before you get a loan. A personal loan’s APR is only different from its interest rate if there are other fees, like an origination fee.
- What is a good personal loan rate?
- A good personal loan rate is one that keeps monthly payments affordable and total interest costs low. The loan with the lowest rate is the least expensive.
- Lenders determine your rate using your credit profile and history, income and existing debts.Here are average personal loan rates for each credit score range.

- Borrowers with poor credit may qualify for a bad-credit personal loan, however, you can improve your chances of qualifying and reduce your rate by getting a joint, co-signed or secured personal loan.
- Next steps: How to get a personal loan
- Once you’ve calculated monthly payments and interest costs, it’s time to compare loan offers and apply. Here’s what’s next:
- Accept your pre-qualified offer and fill out the lender’s formal application. At this time, the lender does a hard credit pull, causing your credit score to temporarily dip. Having documents ready that prove your identity and income, like W-2s and tax forms, can help move the application process more quickly.
- If approved, most personal loan lenders can fund a loan within a week. Some say they’ll send you the money the same or next business day after approval.
- Other loan calculators
- Debt-to-income ratio calculator: Determine your debt-to-income ratio, which is your total monthly debt payments divided by your income.
- Debt consolidation calculator: Learn how debt consolidation works and calculate how much consolidating could save you.
- Credit score needed for a personal loan calculator: See what personal loan options may be available to you, based on your credit score.
- Personal loan refinance calculator: Use this calculator to determine whether refinancing an existing personal loan makes sense.

Financial Tips:
- Many online, bank and credit union lenders allow you to pre-qualify for a personal loan. You give the lender some information about yourself, such as your name, income, desired loan amount and loan purpose, and the lender will do a soft credit check to determine what loan amount, rate and repayment term you may qualify for. Pre-qualify with multiple lenders to find the best offer.
- The loan with the lowest rate and affordable monthly payments is typically the best loan offer. If you have multiple promising offers, compare special loan features to break the tie. Some lenders have credit-building tools, unemployment protection or fast funding.

Application Process:
- Look for lenders that offer special features for debt consolidation. Some lenders, for example, will discount the rate on a debt consolidation loan or send the loan funds directly to your creditors, simplifying the process.
- Use NerdWallet’s debt consolidation calculator to enter all of your debts in one place, see typical rates from lenders and calculate savings.
- Low APRs for good to excellent credit.
- Direct payment to creditors offered by some lenders.
- Hard to get a low rate with bad credit.
- Some loans carry an origination fee.
- 3. Tap your home equity for a loan or line of credit
- Best for: Borrowers with sufficient home equity who are comfortable using their home as collateral for a loan or line of credit.
- If you’re a homeowner, you may be able to take out a loan or line of credit on the equity in your home and use it to pay off your credit cards or other debts.
- A home equity loan is a lump-sum loan that you pay back with a fixed interest rate, meaning you’ll have predictable monthly payments and a clear finish line.
- A HELOC, or home equity line of credit, works like a credit card with a variable interest rate that is typically lower than credit card rates.
- Since both of these types of credit are secured by your house, you’re likely to get a lower rate than what you would find on a personal loan or balance transfer credit card. However, you can also lose your home if you don’t keep up with payments.
- Typically lower interest rates than personal loans.
- May not require good credit to qualify.
- » MORE: Should you use home equity to pay off debt?
- Best for: Borrowers with an employer-sponsored retirement account who can’t qualify for credit elsewhere and have ruled out all other options.
- If you have an employer-sponsored retirement account like a 401(k) plan, you can typically borrow up to half the amount (with a $50,000 maximum), for a term up to five years, to help pay off your debts. These loans usually come with single-digit interest rates, so they’re much cheaper than credit cards, and any interest you pay goes back into your account. Another benefit is this loan won’t show up on your credit report, so there’s no impact on your score.
- But taking out a 401(k) loan is very risky. Not only can it significantly impact your retirement savings, if you can’t repay, you’ll owe a hefty penalty plus taxes on the unpaid balance, and you may be left struggling with more debt.
- Plus, if you lose your job or quit, the loan is automatically due on tax day of the next year.
- Lower interest rates than unsecured loans.
- No impact on your credit score.
- If you lose or leave your job, you may have to quickly pay back your loan.
- » MORE: Weigh the risks and benefits of a 401(k) loan
- 5. Enter a debt management plan
- Best for: Borrowers with credit card debt who have low credit scores and can commit to a payment plan up to five years.
- Debt management plans roll your credit card balances into one monthly payment at a reduced interest rate. You then pay it off over three to five years. These plans work best for those who are struggling to pay off credit card debt but don’t qualify for other options.
- Unlike other credit card consolidation options, opting into a debt management plan won’t hurt your credit score, and if you’re able to make payments on time, it should help.
- But debt management plans typically come with fees, so you’ll want to verify the fee amounts and how they affect your overall payoff plan before making a commitment. Going through a nonprofit credit counseling agency is a good way to find an affordable debt management plan.
- If your credit card debt is more than 40% of your income and can’t be repaid within five years, bankruptcy may be a better option than a debt management plan.
- Doesn't hurt your credit score.
- It may take three to five years to repay your debt.
- What is credit card consolidation?
- Credit card consolidation is when you use another credit product to pay off your credit card balances in one fell swoop. You’re then left with only one payment on your new debt.
- For consolidation to make sense, the new debt should have a lower annual percentage rate than your credit cards, so you save money on interest. You can even apply that savings back to your debt, which will shorten the payoff period and get you out of debt faster.
- You may see “debt settlement” and “debt consolidation” used interchangeably, but they’re not the same thing. Debt settlement is the process of negotiating down a debt for less than you owe, usually with the help of a third party, like a debt settlement company. Debt settlement is much riskier than debt consolidation and can seriously damage your credit.
- How does credit card consolidation work?
- Credit card consolidation works by using a different credit product to pay off your credit card balances at a lower interest rate. The logistics depend on which product you choose.
- For example, if you go with a credit card consolidation loan, you’ll need to apply for the loan with a bank, credit union or online lender. Once approved, you’ll receive the money in your account, which you can use to pay off all your credit cards. You’re then left with one fixed payment on the consolidation loan, which you make monthly, until the loan is paid off in full.
- » MORE: How do debt consolidation loans work?
- Is it a good idea to consolidate credit card debt?
- Consolidating credit card debt is a good idea if you can qualify for a low enough interest rate and pay off the debt during the allotted time period, which will vary based on the consolidation product you choose.
- You’ll also want to be certain you can keep your credit card balances at or near zero while you pay off the new debt. For example, if you take out a consolidation loan to pay off your credit cards, but then accumulate a balance on your credit cards again, you’ll be in a worse position than when you started.
- Can I still use my credit card after debt consolidation?
- If you consolidate your credit cards, you can still use them. Consolidating just means you’re paying them off, so your balances will be at zero, but the cards themselves will remain open unless you take the step of closing them.
- Closing a credit card can hurt your credit score. Financial experts often suggest tying a small recurring expense, like your monthly phone bill, to the card to keep it active. Avoid paying for nonessential expenses with your credit card, since this could delay getting out of debt.
- How can I consolidate credit card debt without hurting my credit?
- Consolidating credit card debt will affect your credit in a few ways. Your credit score may dip when a lender or card issuer does a hard credit inquiry after you apply for a consolidation product. This is usually a small dip (just a few points) and temporary.
- Late payments, though, can more seriously hurt your credit, so it’s important to pay attention to due dates and make all payments on-time. Many lenders also offer automatic payments.
- If you make payments on time and keep debt manageable in the future, the overall effect of consolidating credit card debt could be positive.
- How much does credit card debt consolidation save?
- How much money you save with credit card debt consolidation will depend on the amount of debt you have and the consolidation option you choose. Here’s an example of how you can save with a credit card consolidation loan.
- Let’s say you have $10,000 in credit card debt spread out across four different credit cards, each with an annual percentage rate of about 23%. If you’re making a minimum payment of $75 on each card, it will take you four and a half years to be debt-free, and it will cost you an extra $6,200 in interest, on top of the original debt.
- But if you take out a credit card consolidation loan for $10,000 at 15% APR, and use it to pay off all your credit cards at once, you’ll save $2,841 on interest and get out of debt six months sooner.

====================================================================================================

URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/balance-transfer-calculator


Financial Tips:
- There are countless ways you could choose to pay down your debt. You could pay an equal amount each month (the scenarios in the chart above), or you could pay a variable amount based on what you have available. You could pay once a month or multiple times a month. You could even just pay the "minimum amount due" shown on your statement, which will keep your account in good standing but can also keep you in debt for years.
- No calculator can account for every single potential payment option. Our balance transfer calculator, therefore, assumes that your payment will be the same every month and that it will be the exact amount necessary to pay off the debt within the time frame.
- "With a balance transfer, you have to do the math to make sure that balance transfer fee is worth it. If it saves you money compared with the interest you’d to pay with your current credit card over time, it can be a useful tool for paying down debt aggressively. Have a strategy in place when using a balance transfer credit card. Curb any habits that may have led to the debt, build an emergency fund to prevent further debt and switch your payment method to debit or cash to make more progress on paying off the balance."
- "Balance transfer credit cards can be good debt management tools because they can save you money on interest payments. But you'll still need to be hands on with your debt and have a repayment plan. A late payment can cause you to lose your introductory 0% APR period and result in a penalty APR that’s higher than the card’s regular rate — which can leave you in a worse financial shape than when you started."
- "Many people hoping to do a balance transfer end up surprised and disappointed when they don't get enough of a credit limit to transfer all the debt they need to move. You might have $20,000 in debt you hope to transfer but only get approved to transfer $3,000."
- The cost of debt without a balance transfer
- To give you a better sense of the cost of carrying credit card debt without doing a balance transfer, we've created a second calculator that tells you exactly how much you would need to pay every month to eliminate your debt within a given time frame.
- This isn’t as simple as dividing your debt by the number of months in the repayment period. If you have $1,000 in debt, for instance, paying $100 a month for 10 months won’t get you in the clear, because you'll be charged interest. At 16% interest, you'd have to pay $107.48 a month to completely eliminate the debt in 10 months.
- Tell us how much debt you have, the interest rate on that debt and how many months you'd need to pay it off, and we'll tell you your required monthly payment, the total amount of your payments over your time frame and the total amount you'd pay in interest.
- A balance transfer provides the answer to a common question: "Can I use one credit card to pay off another?" When you request a transfer, the bank that issued your new credit card sends a payment on your old card and then adds that amount to the balance on the new card, along with the balance transfer fee. You can sometimes request a transfer at the time you apply for the new card; you can also call the issuer after you get the card, or use a convenience check.
- Terms and conditions apply. Credit products subject to lender approval.
- Length of 0% introductory period. A good balance transfer credit card will have a 0% period of 15 months or longer. Some give you close to two years at 0%. You might not need that much time, but the longer the 0% period, the more flexibility you have.
- Length of 0% introductory period. A good balance transfer credit card will have a 0% period of 15 months or longer. Some give you close to two years at 0%. You might not need that much time, but the longer the 0% period, the more flexibility you have.
- Some credit cards have a 0% intro period for purchases but not for balance transfers. Before applying for a card to execute a transfer, make sure the card you want does indeed have a 0% period for transferred debt.
- Card issuer. As a general rule, you can't transfer debt between cards from the same issuer. If your current debt is on a Citi card, you can't transfer it to another Citi card. You can't transfer debt from one Wells Fargo card to another, and so on.

- Rewards. It's worth thinking about what you're going to do with your balance transfer credit card down the road, after you've paid off your debt. Many balance transfer cards don't offer a very compelling reason to keep using them after the 0% period runs out — they offer no rewards, and their ongoing interest rates aren't particularly low. However, a number of excellent rewards credit cards offer balance transfer promotions of 15 to 18 months.

- How much money you'll save with a balance transfer actually has more to do with the debt you're moving than with the card you're moving it to. The cost of carrying that debt depends on how much debt you have, the interest rate you're currently being charged on that debt and how long it would take you to pay it off if you didn't transfer it.
- When it comes to the card you're moving the debt to, generally speaking, the lower the balance transfer fee, the greater your savings. And the longer the 0% period, the more time you have to eliminate your debt without paying interest, which can also translate into more savings. See our best balance transfer cards to compare your options.
- A balance transfer will save you money only if the amount you save on interest comes out to be more than the fee you pay to transfer the debt. If you're going to be paying off your debt within a month or two, you might be better off just keeping it where it is and paying it off directly, as opposed to paying 3% to 5% to move it to a different card.
- If any of your transferred balance is still unpaid when the introductory 0% APR period ends, you'll be charged the card's regular interest rate on the remaining portion. Only the remaining debt will incur interest. You will not be charged "retroactive interest" on a card that specifies an introductory rate of 0%. That only happens with "deferred interest" promotions.

Financial Tips:
- Bonus rewards rate. Instead of earning the typical 1 point or 1% cash back for each dollar spent, you might earn double, triple or more rewards in the card’s bonus categories. The rewards rate is often written as a multiplier, such as 2X for double points and 3X for triple points. With cash-back cards, you’ll see it written as 2% back or 3% back.

The rewards rate is often written as a multiplier, such as 2X for double points and 3X for triple points. With cash-back cards, you’ll see it written as 2% back or 3% back.
- When comparing credit cards with bonus categories, look at the categories and rates together. After all, a 5X rewards rate at, say, restaurants is worthless if you never eat out. Similarly, a  rewards rate of 3X points at supermarkets is probably more valuable than 4X points on streaming services because most people spend far more on groceries than on streaming.
- Some bonus rewards rates remain in effect for the life of the card while others change periodically or are limited-time offers. And some cards limit how much spending is eligible for the elevated rates. Keep those limitations in mind when comparing credit cards side by side.
- The “APR” is the interest rate on a credit card. Many credit cards start you out at 0% interest, or at least with a lower rate, for a number of months after you open the account. That can save you money compared with keeping a balance on a high-interest credit card.
- When comparing credit cards with promotional interest rates, check whether the introductory rates apply to new purchases, balance transfers or both.
- What does it apply to? A 0% APR period on purchases and balance transfers is better than a promotional rate on just one of those. A single card may have different interest-rate offers for purchases vs. balance transfers.

- Not all cards have intro APRs. Our side-by-side credit card comparisons show “N/A” for those that don’t.
- If you expect to be carrying debt regularly from month to month, the ongoing APR is important. The ongoing APR is the “regular” interest rate on a card — the rate that applies when there isn’t a promotional rate in effect. Lower is better.
- Credit cards often list their rates within a range of percentages — say, 14.99% to 22.99%. The lower percentages typically apply to cardholders with better credit. You’ll often see the word “variable,” which means the APR will go up or down when the prime rate does.
- Features beyond those discussed above might be called out in the pros and cons section of our card comparison tool. Other factors to consider when comparing credit cards include:
- What matters most to you in a new credit card?
- A rewards credit card gives you points, miles or cash back on every dollar you spend. Some give you the same rewards on everything — maybe 1.5% cash back, or 2 travel miles per dollar. Others pay higher rewards rates in specific categories, making them great for flying on a particular airline or buying gas. Many rewards cards allow new cardholders to earn a bonus by spending a certain amount of money early on. (In our side-by-side card comparison tool, those cards are marked as great for “Bonus offers.”)
- A card with an introductory 0% APR or ongoing low interest could be a good match for you if you need to finance a large purchase or if you have irregular income and need to carry a balance from time to time. A balance transfer offer can help you pay off high-interest debt interest-free.
- If you want to build or rebuild credit
- Student credit cards are designed for college students who are new to credit. They’re easier to qualify for than other types of credit cards.
- Non-students looking to build credit, or people with bad credit, can take a look at secured credit cards, which generally require a security deposit of $200 or more. Your deposit is usually equal to the credit limit on the card — the more you deposit, the higher your limit. The deposit is returned to you when the account is upgraded or closed in good standing.

- Business type. Corporation, LLC, partnership or sole proprietorship. Businesses without a formal or legal business structure can choose “sole proprietor.”
- Personal guarantee. Virtually all small-business credit card applications require a personal guarantee. This means you’re personally responsible for the balance on your business card even if your company goes belly up. Want to avoid the personal guarantee? Look to a corporate card like Ramp or Brex.

- Current mortgage and refinance rates
- 👉 Did you buy a home in 2023? Refinancing might save you money — mortgage rates are down a percentage point compared to last year’s peak. See mortgage rates this week and try our refinance calculator to see how much you could save.
- How to find today’s mortgage refinance rates
- With a mortgage refinance, you replace your current home loan with a new one. Much like when you bought your home, you’ll have to meet the lender’s refinance requirements and go through the application and closing process.
- How much does it cost to refinance a mortgage?
- You don't make a down payment when you refinance, but refinancing isn't free. You'll pay refinance closing costs, which generally run from 2% to 6% of the amount of your new loan. For example: If you're refinancing $250,000, your closing costs could be between $5,000 and $15,000.
- Closing costs on a refinance include:
- Add or remove a borrower from the loan. Changing who's on the mortgage doesn't alter who owns the property — that's what the title or deed is for — but it does affect who's on the hook for the home loan. Generally, if you want to remove someone from your home loan and that person is still living, you'll have to refinance. (This could be necessary in a divorce, for instance.) Note that the person or people remaining on the loan will need to be able to qualify for the refi without that other borrower. It's a similar process to add someone to the mortgage: The new person will need to qualify along with the current borrower.

It's a similar process to add someone to the mortgage: The new person will need to qualify along with the current borrower.
- At what interest rate should you refinance?
- There isn’t a standard rule about when it makes sense to refinance your mortgage. Some experts recommend refinancing if you can lower your mortgage rate by 1% or more. But a smaller drop may still make sense for you. Crunch the numbers with NerdWallet’s mortgage refinance calculator.
- When deciding if you should refinance, consider how much longer you plan to stay in your home. If you plan to move soon, you might not have time to recoup the costs of refinancing, sometimes called the break-even point. You break even on a refinance when the money saved from refinancing outweighs how much you spent on closing costs. Note that if saving money isn't your primary refinancing goal — for example, if you're taking cash out — this isn't a helpful metric.
- Finally: Ask your lender about any prepayment penalties. While these penalties aren’t common, some lenders may charge them if you pay off the loan within the first three to five years of a mortgage. This penalty might apply if you pay off your existing loan while refinancing to a new one.

- How do you get the best mortgage refinance rate?
- To get the best rate, shop around and get quotes from at least three lenders. NerdWallet’s expert-curated list of the best mortgage refinance lenders is a great place to start. When you review the Loan Estimate, see which lender is offering you the best deal by comparing these key details:
- Your credit score: In terms of factors you can alter, your credit score is front and center for influencing the refinance rate you will receive. Check your credit report before refinancing to make sure there aren’t any errors. Build your credit score before refinancing by paying your bills on time and keeping credit utilization low.

- How much debt you have: For a conventional loan refinance, lenders usually want a debt-to-income ratio of no more than 36%. Your DTI is the amount of debt you pay each month divided by your gross, or pre-tax, monthly income.

- Nerdy Tip
- The type of refinance can also affect your interest rate. Lenders generally consider cash-out refinances to be the most risky, because you borrow against home equity and take out a larger loan. As a result, cash-out refinances tend to have higher interest rates than rate-and-term refis.
- Finally: When you pick a lender, lock in your refinance rate. Rates go up and down daily, and a rate lock will prevent the interest rate you've been offered from rising before your loan closes.
- » MORE: How mortgage rates are set
- How does a mortgage refinance work?
- Nerdy Tip
- Some lenders offer no-closing-cost refinances. With these loans, you don’t have to pay the closing costs upfront, but you will pay them one way or another. Lenders cover the cost by charging a higher interest rate or rolling the fees into the loan amount. Increasing your loan amount bumps up your monthly payment and total interest.
- How long does it take to refinance a mortgage?
- Refinancing takes at least four to six weeks. It takes time to go through underwriting and for the lender to get an appraisal. In most instances, this isn't a big deal; it's not like you're waiting to move. But if you’re looking to tap into equity to fix something urgent, a refi may not be your best bet. Depending on the amount you need, you might consider another way to finance major home repairs or renovations.
- When should you refinance your mortgage?
- There are several reasons you might choose to refinance your mortgage. In some cases, you may be able to accomplish multiple goals at once: for example, switching loan types and changing the loan's term.
- You might refinance in order to:
- Lower your interest rate. If rates have dropped since you bought your home or your credit score has improved, a rate and term refinance may allow you to reduce your monthly mortgage payment. A lower interest rate could also save you a considerable amount of cash over the life of the loan.

- Pay off your mortgage quicker. You can pay off your loan faster by refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year mortgage, for example. While your monthly payments will rise, shortening your loan term could dramatically reduce the amount of interest you'll pay.

- Tap into your home equity. With a cash-out refinance, you take out a new mortgage for more than your current loan balance. You receive the difference between the two amounts in cash, which you can use as you like. A cash-out refinance can be risky because you're getting a larger loan with your home as collateral, so it's generally considered safest to use the proceeds for something that improves your bottom line. For example, a major renovation could add to your home's value.

- Switch from an adjustable-rate to a fixed-rate mortgage. If you want more payment stability, you can refinance your adjustable-rate mortgage to a fixed-rate mortgage. After a specified amount of time, the rate on the ARM may adjust higher, while the rate stays the same with a fixed-rate loan.

- Eliminate private mortgage insurance. If you bought your home with less than 20% down on a conventional loan, your lender likely required you to take private mortgage insurance, or PMI. This protects the lender in the event you default on the loan. If you’ve gained enough equity in your home, you can refinance to eliminate the PMI. However, it may make more sense simply to pay for an appraisal to cancel your mortgage insurance early.

- Cancel FHA mortgage insurance. Refinancing is usually necessary to remove FHA mortgage insurance, which is determined by the amount of your down payment, not your equity. Going from an FHA loan to a conventional loan allows you to drop FHA mortgage insurance. But be sure you'll have at least 20% equity, so you don't end up paying private mortgage insurance.

- A personal loan is money you borrow from a bank, credit union or online lender. Loan amounts are from $1,000 to $100,000, and they’re typically repaid over a term of two to seven years. To qualify, lenders look at factors including your credit score, credit history and debt-to-income ratio.
- You can use personal loan funds for nearly any reason. Ideally, getting one positively impacts your overall financial health by helping you pay off debt faster, for example, or adding to the value of your home. Here are some top ways consumers use personal loans:
- 1. Check your credit Review your credit report for errors or accounts that may be weighing on your score and address them before applying. For example, a past-due account could be a reason a lender denies your application. You might decide to postpone getting a loan and instead take steps to build your credit to get a lower rate or a larger loan.

- 2. Review your debt-to-income ratioA low DTI shows lenders that you have enough income for new loan payments. If yours is high (usually above 40%), pay down debt before you apply to improve your chance of qualifying. Make sure to include all sources of income on an application.

- 3. Compare your optionsInterest rates on personal loans for excellent credit start below 10% APR, but if you can qualify for a 0% interest credit card — and pay off the balance within the promotional period — then you may be better off with the credit card. Here's how to compare personal loans and credit cards.

- 4. Consider a co-applicantBorrowers with blemished credit can add a co-signer or co-borrower with better credit and higher income for a better chance of qualifying or a potentially lower rate. Both co-signers and co-borrowers are responsible for repaying the debt if the primary borrower misses payments.

- 6. Assess your overall financial well-beingPersonal loans work best as part of a balanced financial plan. Borrow money to consolidate debt if it means you’ll get out of debt more quickly. But don’t borrow if it only adds financial strain. If your current debt is overwhelming, investigate your debt-relief options.

- Even before you receive your loan, make a plan to pay it off, ensuring you can manage on-time monthly payments for the life of the loan — whether that's two or seven years. Missing even one loan payment can hurt your credit score, and defaulting on the loan can mean late fees and collections calls.
- If you face a financial setback while paying off your loan, reach out to your lender and ask about a hardship option. Some lenders may allow you to defer loan payments for a specified time.

- Personal loans rating methodology
- Our star ratings award points to lenders that offer consumer-friendly features, including: soft credit checks to pre-qualify, competitive interest rates and no fees, transparency of rates and terms, flexible payment options, fast funding times, accessible customer service, reporting of payments to credit bureaus and financial education. We also consider regulatory actions filed by agencies like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We weigh these factors based on our assessment of which are the most important to consumers and how meaningfully they impact consumers’ experiences.
- This methodology applies only to lenders that cap interest rates at 36%, the maximum rate most financial experts and consumer advocates agree is the acceptable limit for a loan to be affordable.
- Where can I get a personal loan?You can get a personal loan from many banks, credit unions and online lenders. Each lender offers different benefits. For example, banks may offer perks for existing customers, while online lenders tend to fund loans more quickly. Credit unions may offer lower rates to borrowers with low credit scores.

- DisclaimerPersonal loans made through Upgrade feature Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) of 7.99%-35.99%. All personal loans have a 1.85% to 9.99% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds. Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existing debt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months. For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month term and a 17.59% APR (which includes a 13.94% yearly interest rate and a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 in your account and would have a required monthly payment of $341.48. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total $12,293.46. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and your loan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actual rate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term, and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and fees may increase the cost of your fixed rate loan. There is no fee or penalty for repaying a loan early. Personal loans issued by Upgrade's bank partners. Information on Upgrade's bank partners can be found at https://www.upgrade.com/bank-partners/ .

- Personal loan interest rates
- Personal loan annual percentage rates typically range from about 6% to 36%. Currently — as a result of macroeconomic uncertainty and changes like high inflation — rates on personal loans are generally high.
- To determine your rate, lenders primarily assess your financial and credit information, but they may also consider factors like whether you own your home, your education level and your work history. Consumer advocates say 36% is the highest annual percentage rate a loan can have and still be considered affordable.
- Borrowers with good to excellent credit scores (690 and higher) typically get the lowest interest rates and can borrow larger amounts. They also have the most options when shopping for a loan.
- Those with fair to bad credit (scores below 690) may have to look a little harder and pay a higher rate for a personal loan. Having steady income, low debt, a long credit history and a record of on-time payments will improve your chances of approval.

- How to compare personal loans
- Rates, terms, funding time and other features vary, so take the time to compare loans from multiple lenders. Here are the most important considerations:
- A loan’s annual percentage rate represents the interest rate plus any fees the lender charges. When comparing offers, APR tells you which is the least expensive overall. It also provides an apples-to-apples comparison across financial products, so you can compare the cost of a personal loan to a credit card, for example.
- Even if a loan has a low APR, you need room in your budget to repay it each month. Your monthly payment is determined by the loan amount, interest rate and repayment term. A shorter term may mean higher monthly payments, but you’ll pay less in interest over the life of the loan. Use the personal loan calculator above to see how the rate and repayment terms affect the monthly payment.
- The most common fees on personal loans are late and origination fees. An origination fee can be 1% to 10% of your loan amount, and lenders typically deduct the fee before sending you the funds. If your lender charges this fee, make sure the final loan amount will be enough to cover your expenses.
- Many lenders can fund a loan within a day or two of approval, but some take up to a week to send you the money. If you need cash fast, compare quick personal loans to find a lender that offers same- or next-day funding.
- » MORE: How long does it take to get a personal loan?
- Some lenders let you choose your initial payment date and allow multiple changes during repayment, while others require you to pay on the same date each month for the life of the loan. Since you could be repaying this loan for years, consider whether you’ll want the option to change your due date, skip a payment or pause payments during a hardship.
- If you have a couple of competitive offers, consider other personal loan features to break the tie. Some lenders offer rate discounts, no fees, extra long repayment terms on home improvement loans or direct fund transfers to other creditors on debt consolidation loans.
- Personal loan pros and cons
- Few restrictions on loan purpose.
- Consolidate high-interest debt.
- Rates can be lower than credit cards.
- On-time payments help build credit.
- Strong credit and income needed for lowest rates.
- Increase your debt load.
- Missed payments negatively impact credit.
- Before you get a personal loan
- Pre-qualify and compare offers. Most online lenders allow you to pre-qualify without affecting your credit score. Check your rate with multiple lenders to find the best offer. If you have good credit and an existing banking relationship, take a pre-qualified loan offer to your bank and ask if they’ll beat it. Once you have multiple loan offers in hand, compare the loan features and fine print, including total costs and any penalties.

End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD). Accessed May 8, 2024.View all sources. Retroactive start dates are common, going back as many as 12 months. If certain conditions are met, the waiting period may be waived.
- When to apply for Medicare
- If you wait until your birthday month or the three months afterward to apply for Medicare, your coverage will start the following month. If you miss your initial window, you will need to sign up during Medicare's general enrollment period.

Application Process:
- It’s crucial to know how to handle debt collectors —including understanding what debt collectors can and cannot do — so you can assert your rights and choose the best way to manage your debt. Before you say anything or make any payments, follow these steps:
- What is a debt collector and what do they do?
- A debt collector is a person, agency or company responsible for collecting money owed, usually on a past-due account. Debt collectors may call you or send mail notices, emails or text messages about a debt.
- When a debt goes unpaid for several months, the original creditor will often sell it to an outside agency. The buyer is known as a third-party debt collector. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which sets rules for consumer debt collection, generally applies to third-party collectors only.
- 6 steps for dealing with a debt collector
- Just as you wouldn’t jump into a contract without understanding its terms, don’t rush to make a payment when a debt collector contacts you. Take time to think through your options to pay off a debt in collections.
- Debt collectors may pressure you to take action quickly. Don’t pay, don't promise to pay, and don't give any payment information the collector may use later. Ask for information on the debt and say you'll call back to discuss it later.
- Making a single payment — even just $5 or $10 — is an acknowledgment of the debt and can have serious repercussions. If the debt is past the statute of limitations, for example, making a payment will reset that clock and could lead to a lawsuit or wage garnishment.
- When the original creditor sells a debt to a third party — which might go on to resell the debt again, and so on — recordkeeping often falls by the wayside. Many sold debts have errors about the amount owed or even who owes it.
- Debt collection practices are one of the largest sources of consumer complaints to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a result. Nearly 110,000 complaints were filed in 2023 on the matter; the biggest reason was consumers being asked to pay debt they didn’t owe[0]Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Consumer Response Annual Report. Accessed Nov 1, 2024.View all sources.
- If a debt collector contacts you, gather a few key pieces information:
- Request a validation letter from the debt collector if you don’t receive one within five business days of first contact. It should include details on the debt, the collection company and how to challenge the debt.
- Request a validation letter from the debt collector if you don’t receive one within five business days of first contact. It should include details on the debt, the collection company and how to challenge the debt.
- Gather your own records on the debt, if it’s yours, including information on the original creditor and your history of payments.
- Gather your own records on the debt, if it’s yours, including information on the original creditor and your history of payments.
- Keep good records of communication with the debt collector. You may want to use certified mail for the best documentation.
- Keep good records of communication with the debt collector. You may want to use certified mail for the best documentation.
- 3. Know your rights around communicating with debt collectors
- The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is your ally. This law outlines your rights as a consumer and shields you from predatory collection tactics. For instance:
- You can specify how and when debt collectors can contact you — and that they cease communication altogether[0]Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. How do I get a debt collector to stop calling or contacting me?.View all sources. Debt collectors are prohibited from using profane language or threatening violence.

How do I get a debt collector to stop calling or contacting me?.View all sources. Debt collectors are prohibited from using profane language or threatening violence.
- Debt collectors cannot mislead you about who they are, how much money you owe, or the legal repercussions of not paying your debt — for instance, by threatening arrest.
- Debt collectors cannot mislead you about who they are, how much money you owe, or the legal repercussions of not paying your debt — for instance, by threatening arrest.
- 4. Submit a complaint if the debt collector violates your rights
- Understand your federal and state protections in the debt collection process. You can file a complaint with the CFPB if your protections under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act have been violated. Your state may offer additional consumer protections. Your state's attorney general and the Federal Trade Commission are good resources.
- Whether it's sending a letter to debt collectors to request more information on the debt, or demanding that a debt collector cease contact, know how to exercise your consumer rights — and don’t be afraid to do so.

- 5. Never ignore a court summons for debt collection
- Lawsuits for collections accounts are a common and efficient way for collection agencies to get payment. These lawsuits can result in wage garnishment, and a bank levy or a lien on your property. Hire an attorney who specializes in debt collection defense. If you can’t afford court costs, look for low-cost or free legal aid programs near you via the Legal Services Corporation or LawHelp.org.
- 6. Choose a debt payoff method or dispute debt collection
- The two most common ways to handle a debt in collections are choosing a payoff method or disputing the debt as being in error:
- There are a few options for paying a collections account: setting up a payment plan, wiping out the debt with a single payment, or settling the debt to reduce the amount you owe. No matter which option you choose, do not give the collector permission to access your bank account, either by providing your debit card number or setting up automated debits. If you make an agreement for a payment plan or to settle the debt for less than is owed, get the agreement in writing so you can hold the collector accountable.

If you make an agreement for a payment plan or to settle the debt for less than is owed, get the agreement in writing so you can hold the collector accountable.
- You can dispute the debt if you think the information is incorrect, or ask for a goodwill deletion if you've already paid it off. Send a written request to the debt collector and make a copy for yourself. If you challenge the debt within 30 days of first contact, the collector cannot ask for payment until the dispute is settled. After 30 days you can still challenge the debt, but the collector can seek payment while the dispute is being investigated.

Application Process:
- Lenders will often require you to attend a Title IV school, which means your school processes federal student aid. Some lenders don't offer loans in certain states.

- Can I get a private student loan with bad credit?
- You’ll have a harder time finding a private student loan from a bank, credit union or online lender if you have bad credit. Federal student loans don’t require borrowers to demonstrate creditworthiness, so they’ll be your best option if you have bad credit. If you’ve already hit your limit on federal loans, you may be able to get a private student loan if you apply with a co-signer who has solid credit — typically scores in the high 600s or better.
- » MORE: Student loans for borrowers with bad or no credit
- Will I need a co-signer for a private student loan?
- If you have no income and no credit or bad credit, you’ll need a co-signer to get a private student loan. Without bills in your name, such as a credit card, car loan or utility, it's hard to demonstrate that you can pay bills on time. Your co-signer will need a steady income and good credit scores. A co-signer is responsible for repaying the loan if you fail to make payments.
- Some private lenders will let students apply without a co-signer. Instead of basing your loan offer on your credit, they look at your academic performance and earning potential to determine your ability to pay back the debt.

- How do I apply for a private student loan?
- Follow these steps to apply for a private student loan.
- Check your local banks, credit unions and state-based agencies to find private student loans. Online lenders also offer private loans, though be sure to review the fine print for a thorough understanding of interest type (fixed or variable), rates and fees.
- 2. Know the requirements.
- Each lender has its own application requirements. You’ll usually need to provide documents that prove citizenship, identity and income along with school information, like cost of attendance or the financial aid award letter from your college.
- You or your co-signer will need to have credits scores in the high 600s or higher, as well as cash flow to make loan payments. Lenders will also look at your or your co-signer’s debt-to-income ratio to make sure you have the funds to pay a student loan bill in addition to any other bills in your name.
- 3. Compare lenders before applying.

The Custom Choice Loan® is made by Citizens (“Lender”). All loans are subject to individual approval and adherence to Lender’s underwriting guidelines. Program restrictions and other terms and conditions apply. LENDER AND MONOGRAM LLC EACH RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE PRODUCTS AND BENEFITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. TERMS, CONDITIONS AND RATES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. Interest rates and APRs (Annual Percentage Rates) depend upon (1) the student’s and cosigner’s (if applicable) credit histories, (2) the repayment option and repayment term selected, (3) the expected number of years in deferment, (4) the requested loan amount and (5) other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate applicable to your loan. Rates and terms are effective as of 3/1/2025 The variable interest rate for each calendar month is calculated by adding the 30-Day Average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) index, or a replacement index if the SOFR index is no longer available, plus a fixed margin assigned to each loan. The SOFR index is published on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The current SOFR index is 4.35% as of 3/1/2025. The variable interest rate will increase or decrease if the SOFR index changes or if a new index is chosen. The applicable index or margin for variable rate loans may change over time and result in a different APR than shown. The fixed rate assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the auto pay discount. APRs assume a $10,000 loan with one disbursement. The high fixed rate APR assumes a 7-year term with the Flat Payment Repayment option, a 1 month deferment period, and a six month grace period before entering repayment. The high variable rate APR assumes a 7-year term with the Fully Deferred Repayment option, a deferment period greater than 30 months, and a six-month grace period before entering repayment. The low APRs assume a 7-year term, and the Immediate Repayment option with payments beginning 30-60 days after the disbursement via auto pay. Auto pay yields a 0.25% interest rate reduction which is applied after the Servicer validates your bank account information. Automatic payments and the associated discount will be temporarily discontinued (1) if you elect to stop automatic deduction of payments and (2) during periods when you are not required to make payments. The discount will be permanently discontinued in the event three automatic deductions are returned by the financial institution for any reason. The auto pay discount is not available when reduced payments are being made or when the loan is in a deferment. Custom Choice Loan® is a registered trademark of Monogram LLC.

However, MPOWER offers borrowers a way to qualify for a discount; a 0.25% rate discount is possible by making your loan payments through automatic withdrawal from your bank account.

- Only borrow what you need and can expect to pay back. Start with federal loans, and take private loans if you need additional funds to pay for college.
- The maximum in federal student loans you can borrow depends on your year in school, whether you’re a dependent or independent student and the type of loan. With private loans, the amount you borrow can’t exceed your school’s total cost of attendance, less other financial aid.
- A 2024 high school graduate who will depend on student loans to pay for college can expect to borrow about $37,000 for their bachelor’s degree, according to a recent NerdWallet analysis.

- How do I choose a private student loan online?
- 1. Compare loan offers
- Check options from multiple lenders including banks, credit unions, online companies and state-based lenders to find the lowest interest rate.
- Depending on the lender, you may be able to choose a fixed or a variable interest rate. A fixed rate stays the same throughout the life of a loan; a variable rate may start out lower than a fixed rate, but could increase or decrease over time depending on economic conditions.
- 3. Choose a loan term
- You may also have the option to choose your loan term. A short term gives you higher monthly payments, but also faster repayment and less total interest. A longer term allows you to pay less each month, but more interest over a longer period of time.
- 4. Consider borrower protections

- Will I qualify for a private student loan?
- Each lender has its own qualification requirements. Credit score and income are key considerations for most student loans. Borrowers with higher credit scores and incomes tend to get the best rates and highest loan amounts.
- Since undergraduate borrowers are unlikely to have established credit or income, lenders will usually prompt students to apply with a co-signer. Some lenders who offer loans for borrowers without a co-signer will consider academic performance and income potential.
- Shop around to gather and compare data on interest rates, repayment terms and co-signer requirements from multiple lenders before deciding on one. It may be helpful to read online reviews of lenders to gain insight from other consumers’ experiences.
- How do student loan interest rates work?
- Learn more about how student loan interest rates are determined, including a history of rate changes through the years. Private student loan interest rates can sometimes be lower than federal rates, but approval for the lowest rates requires excellent credit. If you have good credit, you may be able to refinance existing student loans to get a lower rate.
- Our survey of more than 26 banks, credit unions and online lenders offering student loans and student loan refinancing includes the top 10 lenders by market share and top 10 lenders by online search volume, as well as lenders that serve specialty or nontraditional markets.

Application Process:
- Use our step-by-step guide to getting life insurance quotes, and find the right coverage for you and your family.
- To get life insurance quotes, you’ll typically need to provide basic details about yourself, such as your age, weight, height, smoking habit, home address, income, marital status and occupation.
- When you've found the right policy, it's time to apply. Whether you apply for life insurance online, in person or over the phone, you may be asked to provide your Social Security number, driver’s license number or list of current medications. So gather the information you need before you start the life insurance application process.
- A life insurance beneficiary is the person who will receive the payout when you die. Be sure you have their personal details such as Social Security numbers and dates of birth when applying.
- NerdWallet’s life insurance ratings are based on consumer experience, complaint index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for individual life insurance, and weighted averages of financial strength ratings, which indicate a company’s ability to pay future claims. Within the consumer experience category, we consider ease of communication and website transparency, which looks at the depth of policy details available online. To calculate each insurer’s rating, we adjusted the scores to a curved 5-point scale.
- These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our editorial guidelines.
- NerdWallet examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2021-2023. To assess how insurers compare with one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC. Ratios are determined separately for auto, home (including renters and condo) and life insurance.
- Who needs life insurance?In general, people need life insurance if their death would place a financial burden on others. Examples include breadwinners, parents, homeowners, business owners and people with co-signed debt.
- In general, people need life insurance if their death would place a financial burden on others. Examples include breadwinners, parents, homeowners, business owners and people with co-signed debt.
- How much life insurance do I need?The amount of life insurance you need depends on how much money you want your beneficiaries to receive when you die. Ten times your annual income is a common estimate, but rules like this are not universal and may not reflect your specific situation. Take into account your current finances and future obligations — such as income, debts and daily expenses — when calculating your coverage needs.

Financial Tips:
- There are three ways to compare quotes. You can go directly to each life insurer by visiting its website or speaking to one of its agents. Or, you can work with a broker, who collects quotes from multiple companies for you. Alternatively, you can use an online life insurance comparison tool that generates quotes from a range of companies at once*.
- A life insurance agent or broker can help you navigate your options and fill out your application.
- Complaint ratios
- You can check a company’s complaint ratio through the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Our ratings methodology favors companies that have fewer complaints to state regulators.

- Before applying, confirm details on the issuer’s website.
- Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card
- The Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is probably the best-known general-purpose travel credit card, thanks to its ubiquitous advertising. You earn 5 miles per dollar on hotels and car rentals booked through Capital One Travel and 2 miles per dollar on all other purchases. Miles can be redeemed at a value of 1 cent apiece for any travel purchase, without the blackout dates and other restrictions of branded hotel and airline cards. The card offers a great sign-up bonus and other worthwhile perks (see rates and fees). Read our review.
- Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card - Miles Boost
- With the Capital One VentureOne Rewards Credit Card - Miles Boost, you don't pay an annual fee, but you also don't get rewards as rich as those on the regular Venture card (see rates and fees). Still, the bonus offer makes this a solid card for starting out with travel rewards. Read our review.
- The high annual fee on the Chase Sapphire Reserve® gives many potential applicants pause, but frequent travelers should be able to wring enough value out of this card to more than make up for the cost. Cardholders get bonus rewards (up to 10X) on dining and travel, a fat bonus offer, annual travel credits, airport lounge access, and a 50% boost in point value when redeeming points for travel booked through Chase. Points can also be transferred to about a dozen airline and hotel partners. Read our review.
- Capital One Venture X Rewards Credit Card
- Capital One's premium travel credit card can deliver terrific benefits — provided you're willing to do your travel spending through the issuer's online booking portal. That's where you'll earn the highest rewards rates plus credits that can make back the bulk of your annual fee (see rates and fees). Read our review.
- The Platinum Card® from American Express comes with a hefty annual fee, but travelers who like to go in style (and aren't afraid to pay for comfort) can more than get their money's worth. Enjoy extensive airport lounge access, hundreds of dollars a year in travel and shopping credits, hotel benefits and more. That's not even getting into the high rewards rate on eligible travel purchases and the rich welcome offer for new cardholders. Read our review.
- The American Express® Gold Card can earn you a pile of points from everyday spending, with generous rewards at U.S. supermarkets, at restaurants and on certain flights booked through amextravel.com. Other benefits include hundreds of dollars a year in available dining and travel credits and a solid welcome offer for new cardholders. There's an annual fee, though, and a pretty substantial one, so it's not for smaller spenders. Read our review.
- Bilt World Elite Mastercard® Credit Card
- The Bilt World Elite Mastercard® Credit Card stands out by offering credit card rewards on rent payments without incurring an additional transaction fee. The ability to earn rewards on what for many people is their single biggest monthly expense makes this card worth a look for any renter. You also get bonus points on dining and travel when you make at least five transactions on the card each statement period, and redemption options include point transfers to partner hotel and loyalty programs. Read our review.
- Our pick for: Credit union rewards
- With premium perks for a $95 annual fee (which can be waived in some cases), jet-setters will get a lot of value from the PenFed Pathfinder® Rewards Visa Signature® Card. It also offers a generous rewards rate on travel purchases and a decent flat rate on everything else. Plus, you’ll get travel credits and a Priority Pass membership that offers airport lounge access for $32 per visit. Read our review.
- Marriott Bonvoy Boundless® Credit Card
- The Marriott Bonvoy Boundless® Credit Card is a worthwhile card whose benefits — especially a free night every year — can easily make up for its annual fee. Not only does Marriott have a wide selection of locations, both economy and upscale, but the card doesn't limit you to using points only for hotel stays. Read our review.
- Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card
- The Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card starts you off with one of the biggest sign-up bonuses of any credit card anywhere: Earn 90,000 bonus points after you spend $8,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. You also get bonus rewards on travel expenses and common business spending categories, like advertising, shipping and internet, cable and phone service. Points are worth 25% more when redeemed for travel booked through Chase, or you can transfer them to about a dozen airline and hotel partners. Learn more and apply.
- Modern-day adventurers and once-a-year vacationers alike love the idea of earning rewards toward their next big trip. According to a NerdWallet study, 68% of American adults say they have a credit card that earns travel rewards.
- With a travel rewards credit card, you earn points or miles every time you use the card, but you can often earn more points per dollar in select categories. Some top travel credit cards, such as the Chase Sapphire Reserve®, offer bonus points on any travel spending, while the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless® Credit Card grants bonus points when you use the card at Marriott hotels, grocery stores, restaurants or gas stations.
- Not all points and miles earned on travel rewards credit cards are the same:
- General-purpose travel credit cards — including the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, the American Express® Gold Card and the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card — give you rewards that can be used like cash to pay for travel or that can be exchanged for points in airline or hotel loyalty programs. With their flexible rewards, general-purpose options are usually the best travel credit cards for those who don't stick to a single airline or hotel chain.

- Airline- and hotel-specific cards — such as the United℠ Explorer Card and the Hilton Honors American Express Card — give points and miles that can be used only with the brand on the card. (Although it's possible in some cases to transfer hotel points to airlines, we recommend against it because you get a poor value.) These so-called co-branded cards are usually the best travel credit cards for those who always fly one particular airline or stay with one hotel group.

- HOW TO CHOOSE A TRAVEL CREDIT CARD
- There are scores of travel rewards cards to choose from. The best travel credit card for you has as much to do with you as with the card. How often you travel, how much flexibility you want, how much you value airline or hotel perks — these are all things to take into account when deciding on a travel card. Our article on how to choose a travel credit card recommends that you prioritize:
- Even with these goals in mind, there are all kinds of considerations that will influence your decision on a travel rewards credit card.
- The very first question to ask yourself when choosing a travel credit card is: Should I get a travel card at all? Travel credit cards are best for frequent travelers, who are more likely to get enough value from rewards and perks to make up for the annual fees that the best travel credit cards charge. (Some travel cards charge no annual fee, but they tend to offer lesser rewards than full-fee cards.) A NerdWallet study found that those who travel only occasionally — say, once a year — will probably get greater overall rewards from cash-back credit cards, most of which charge no annual fee, than from a travel card.
- Travel credit cards fall into two basic categories: co-branded cards and general travel cards.
- Co-branded cards carry the name of an airline or hotel group, such as the United℠ Explorer Card or the Marriott Bonvoy Boundless® Credit Card. The rewards you earn are redeemable only with that particular brand, which can limit your flexibility, sometimes sharply. For example, if your credit card's co-branded airline partner doesn't have any award seats available on the flight you want on the day you want, you're out of luck. On the other hand, co-branded cards commonly offer airline- or hotel-specific perks that general travel cards can't match.

On the other hand, co-branded cards commonly offer airline- or hotel-specific perks that general travel cards can't match.
- General travel cards aren't tied to a specific airline or hotel, so they offer much greater flexibility. Well-known general travel cards include the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card and the Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. Rewards on general travel cards come as points (sometimes called "miles" but they're really points) that you can redeem for any travel expense. You're not locked into using a single airline or hotel, but you also won't enjoy the perks of a co-branded card.

- Evaluating general travel credit cards
- The credit cards featured at the top of this page are general travel cards. They're issued by a bank (such as Chase or Capital One), carry only that bank's name, and aren't tied to any single airline or hotel group. With these cards, you earn points on every purchase — usually 1 to 2 points per dollar spent, sometimes with additional points in certain categories.

- Statement credit. This lets you essentially erase travel purchases by using your points for credit on your statement. You make travel arrangements however you want (directly with an airline or hotel, through a travel agency, etc.) and charge it to your card. Once the charge shows up on your account, you apply the necessary points and eliminate the cost.

- These programs differ in how much their points are worth and how you can use them. Some offer the full range of redemption options, including transfers to loyalty programs. Others let you use them only to book travel or get statement credit.
- Evaluating airline credit cards
- Airline credit cards earn "miles" with each purchase. You typically get 1 mile per dollar spent, with a higher rate (2 or more miles per dollar) on purchases with the airline itself. (Some airline cards have also begun offering extra miles for purchases in additional categories, such as restaurants or car rental agencies.) These miles go into the same frequent-flyer account as the ones you earn by flying the airline, and you can redeem them for free flights with the airline or its alliance partners.
- Priority boarding. Holders of co-branded airline credit cards often get to board the plane early — after the airline's elite-status frequent flyers but before the general population. This gives you time to settle in and gives you a leg up on claiming that coveted overhead bin space.

- A boost toward elite status. Miles earned with a credit card, as opposed to those earned from actually flying on the airline, usually do not count toward earning elite status in an airline's frequent-flyer program. However, carrying an airline's high-end card might automatically qualify you for a higher tier within the program.

However, carrying an airline's high-end card might automatically qualify you for a higher tier within the program.
- The biggest U.S. airlines — American, United and Delta — offer an array of credit cards. Each airline has a no-annual-fee card that earns miles on purchases but provides little in the way of perks (no free bags or priority boarding). Each has a high-end card with an annual fee in the neighborhood of $450 that offers lounge access and sumptuous perks. And each has a "middle-class" card with a fee of around $100 and solid ongoing perks. Southwest offers three credit cards with varying fees; smaller carriers may just have a single card.

- Which airline card you get depends in large part on what airline you fly, and that's heavily influenced by where you live. Alaska Airlines, for example, has an outstanding credit card, but the airline's routes are concentrated primarily on the West Coast. So it's not a great option for those who live in, say, Buffalo, New York, or Montgomery, Alabama.
- If your local airport is dominated by a single airline, then you're probably flying that carrier most (or all) of the time by default. Delta, for example, is the 800-pound gorilla at Minneapolis-St. Paul and Salt Lake City. United has the bulk of the traffic at Newark and Washington Dulles. American calls the shots at Charlotte and Dallas-Fort Worth. That airline's credit card may be your only realistic option. If you're in a large or midsize market with frequent service from multiple airlines, you have more choice.

- Evaluating hotel credit cards
- Hotel credit cards earn points with each purchase. As with airline cards, you typically get more points per dollar for purchases from the co-brand partner, and some cards also give bonus points in additional categories. (Hotel cards tend to give you a greater number of points overall than airline cards, but each individual point is generally worth less than a typical airline mile.) Similar to the airline model, the points you earn with the card go into the same loyalty account as the points you earn from actually staying at a hotel. You redeem your points for free stays.

- HOW TO COMPARE TRAVEL CREDIT CARDS
- No travel rewards credit card is going to have everything you want. You're going to be disappointed if you expect to find a high rewards rate, a generous sign-up bonus, top-notch perks and no annual fee. Each card delivers value through a different combination of features; it's up to you to compare cards based on the following features and choose the best travel credit card for your needs and preferences.
- Can you find good cards without an annual fee? Absolutely! There are no-fee options on our list of the best travel credit cards, and we've rounded up more here. Just be aware that if you go with a no-fee travel card, you'll earn rewards at a lower rate, your sign-up bonus will be smaller, and you won't get as many (if any) perks.
- When comparing rewards rates, don't just look at the numbers. Look at the categories to which those numbers apply, and find a card that matches your spending patterns. Getting 5 points per dollar seems great — but if those 5X points come only on purchases at, say, office supply stores, and you don't spend money on office supplies, then you're getting lousy value.
- Travel cards tend to have the biggest sign-up bonuses — tens of thousands of points that you earn by hitting a certain amount of spending. But there's more to consider when comparing sign-up bonuses than just how many points or miles you earn. You must also take into account how much you have to spend to earn the bonus. While cash-back credit cards often require just $500 to $1,000 in spending over three months to unlock a bonus, travel cards commonly have thresholds of $3,000 to $5,000.
- Never spend money you don't have just to earn a sign-up bonus. Carrying $3,000 in debt for a year in order to earn a $500 bonus doesn't make economic sense — the interest you'll pay could easily wipe out the value of the bonus.
- Not all travel credit cards are great companions for international travel. While Visa and Mastercard are good pretty much worldwide, you may encounter limited acceptance for American Express and, especially, Discover, depending on the destination. This doesn't mean world travelers should dismiss AmEx and Discover. Just know that if you take one of these cards with you overseas, you'd be smart to bring along a backup in case you run into acceptance problems. (Having a backup card is good advice within the U.S., too, really.)
- "Rewards" are what you get for using a credit card — the points earned with each transaction and the bonuses you unlock with your spending. "Perks" are goodies that you get just for carrying the card. There's a very close correlation between the annual fee on a card and the perks you get for carrying it. Cards with no annual fee are all about rewards and go very light on perks. Premium cards with annual fees of $450 or more are laden with perks (although sometimes their rewards aren't too special). Midtier cards (in the $100 range) tend to have solid rewards and a handful of high-value perks.
- The sign-up bonus gives you a big head-start on travel. Bonuses on the best travel credit cards typically run $500 or more — enough for a roundtrip ticket in many instances.

- Perks make travel less expensive and more relaxing. You won't have to worry about cramming a week's worth of clothes into a carry-on if your travel credit card gives you a free checked bag (or automatically reimburses you for the bag fee). Hate the crush of travelers in the terminal? Escape to the airport lounge. Renting a car? Use a travel card that provides primary rental car insurance.

- No foreign transaction fee can mean big savings. Take just any old credit card with you on vacation outside the U.S., and $1,000 worth of purchases can cost you $30 off the top due to the foreign transaction surcharge. Good travel cards don't charge this fee.

- "Double dipping" gives you more points on travel purchases. Buy a plane ticket or book a hotel room, and you'll earn loyalty points or miles regardless of how you pay. Use the right credit card, though, and you'll earn even more points and miles on top of those.

- Strategic redemption can multiply your value. With cash-back credit cards, 1 cent is worth 1 cent, and that's just how it goes. The points and miles on many travel credit cards have variable value based on how you redeem them — booking travel with them vs. transferring them to a partner, booking domestic vs. international flights and economy vs. business class, staying at budget hotels vs. high-end resorts, and so on.

- The best cards charge annual fees. In many cases, the value you get from a credit card more than makes up for the annual fee. But some people are dead set against paying a fee under any circumstances. If that's you, your options in travel cards will be sharply limited, and you won't get the perks that provide a big portion of the value on many cards.

- Sign-up bonus spending requirements can be steep. A bonus worth $500, $600 or $700 is attractive, but only if you can afford to earn it with spending you were going to do anyway. If you have to amass thousands of dollars in debt and then pay interest on it, it's not worth it.

- Cash back is simpler and more flexible. Some travel cards allow you to redeem your rewards only for travel. Others give you poor value unless you redeem for travel. Still others have complicated redemption options, making it hard to get the most out of your rewards. With cash-back credit cards, you can use your rewards on anything, you know exactly how much your rewards are worth, and redemption is usually simple.

- Rewards cards tend to charge higher interest rates.  If you regularly carry a balance from month to month, a travel credit card — or any rewards credit card — probably isn't your best choice. The interest you pay is eating up the value of your rewards. You're better off with a low-interest card that reduces the cost of carrying debt.

- It’s worth considering whether a travel credit card is even right for you in the first place. A NerdWallet study found that cash-back credit cards often earn more money — even for many travelers.
- If you carry a balance from month to month, the higher interest rates typically charged by rewards cards can cancel out any rewards earned. If you have a good credit score, you're better off with a low-interest credit card that can save you money on interest.

Learn how NerdWallet rates credit cards.
- How do travel credit cards work?
- Travel credit cards earn points (sometimes called miles) each time you buy something. The standard earning rate is 1 to 2 points per dollar spent, and many cards give you extra points for certain purchases, particularly travel expenses. The value of a point depends on the card that earned it and how you redeem it, but a good rule of thumb is to assume each point is worth an average of about 1 cent.
- Your points accumulate in a rewards account, where you can use them to pay for travel. Most cards let you book travel directly using a portal similar to those at online travel agencies or on airline and hotel websites, but instead of paying cash, you pay with your points. Depending on the card, you may also have the option of booking travel any way you want, paying for it with the card and then cashing in your points for a credit against those expenses.
- What’s the difference between points and miles on a credit card?
- Points and miles are just different names for the same thing: the currency used in a travel rewards program. Some travel credit cards call them points, some call them miles.
- How much is a point or mile worth on a travel credit card?
- What kinds of travel credit cards are there?
- Travel credit cards fall into two main categories: co-branded and general-purpose.
- • General-purpose travel cards are issued by a credit card company and are not directly tied to any particular airline or hotel. They earn points in the issuer's own program, such as American Express Membership Rewards, Chase Ultimate Rewards® or Citi ThankYou. These points are a lot more flexible, as you can use them to pay for a range of travel expenses, including flights on any airline or stays at any hotel. However, they don’t offer the airline- or hotel-specific perks of co-branded cards.
- What credit score do I need to get a travel rewards credit card?
- Travel cards — like rewards cards in general — typically require good to excellent credit for approval. Good credit is generally defined as a credit score of 690 or better. However, credit scores alone do not guarantee approval. Every issuer has its own criteria for evaluating applications.
- Business travel can earn credit card rewards just like leisure travel. Credit cards that earn rewards for travel purchases don't distinguish between one or the other — meaning, if a card pays 3X points on airfare, for example, it's going to pay it no matter why you're buying the ticket. There are also travel credit cards specifically designed for business operators, with benefits and perks better aligned with their needs.
- Where things get complicated is when you're not arranging the travel yourself. With credit card points, the rewards go to the cardholder. So if you arrange travel through your employer and the cost goes on the "company card," then the company card gets the points. Put it on your own card and get reimbursed later, and you get the points. (And if you have a company card with your name on it? That may come down to company policy.)
- When redeeming travel rewards, you want to get as much value as possible. If you can get more value by using your rewards than by using cash, then it's smart to do so. (And of course, the reverse also applies.) NerdWallet has calculated the baseline values of most major credit card points, airline miles and hotel points. When you get a value that exceeds these baselines, go ahead and use your rewards. If not, consider using cash.
- What travel credits are easiest to redeem?
- A number of travel credit cards come with "travel credits," which reimburse you for specific expenses. The Chase Sapphire Reserve®, for example, has a $300 annual travel credit; several cards offer credits toward things like airline fees or hotel bookings; and a bunch of cards have a credit for the application fee for TSA PreCheck or Global Entry.
- The less restrictive a credit is, the easier it is to redeem. The easiest travel credit to redeem is one that:
- Applies to a broad range of expenses. Some credits are very fickle. You may get $200 a year in "airline credit," but it applies only to incidental fees (not airfare) on a single airline that you have to choose ahead of time. A card may offer hundreds of dollars in credit toward travel, but you have to go through the issuer's booking portal, where rates may be more expensive and options more limited. Other credits, however, are broad and open-ended: $300 on any travel expense, $100 toward any airline booking, and so on.

- Shows up automatically on your statement. Your issuer's system should be able to recognize qualifying expenses and then apply the credit to them without you having to do anything. If the only way to receive the credit is by calling a phone number or submitting receipts or other documentation, that makes it harder to redeem, which in turn makes it less likely that you'll redeem (and that may be the point).

Financial Tips:
- Avoid applying for multiple credit accounts close together.
- Credit applications can cause a small, temporary drop in your score. However, multiple applications during a short period of time can cause significant damage. NerdWallet recommends spacing applications by about six months if you can.
- Keep credit card accounts open.
- Unless you have a compelling reason to close an account, like a high annual fee or poor customer service, consider keeping it open. Closing an account can affect your credit utilization. You can also explore downgrading it or transferring your credit limit to another card.
- Check your credit scores and reports
- There are two barometers you should regularly check to keep your credit building journey on track:
- Credit reports
- A credit report is a record of how you've used credit in the past.
- You have three credit reports, one from each major credit bureau. Your credit report contains your personal information — your name, addresses, phone numbers — a list of all your accounts and their balances, credit inquiries made by lenders and negative information, including missed payments, bankruptcies.
- Request your credit reports and check each for errors and discrepancies. You can check your reports for free weekly by using AnnualCreditReport.com. Dispute any credit report errors you find that might be lowering your scores.
- You can request your credit report in Spanish directly from each of the three major credit bureaus:
- Usted puede solicitar una copia de su informe crediticio (gratis y en español) de cada una de las tres principales agencias de crédito:
- Credit scores
- Your credit score predicts how you'll handle credit in the future, using the information in your credit reports.
- Your credit scores might differ slightly based on which company is calculating the score (FICO or VantageScore). Your credit score is not found on your credit reports, but you can look at your monthly bank statements or bank app to get a free score.
- The most important thing you can do to build a strong score is to make all your payments on time. FICO and VantageScore, the two major credit scoring companies, weigh payment history as the biggest credit scoring factor. That means, somewhere between 30% to 35% of your credit score is determined by your record of making on-time payments.
- If you’re just starting out, you might be wondering how long it takes to build credit. Building a good credit score takes time and a history of on-time payments. To have a FICO score, you need at least one account that’s been open six months or longer and at least one creditor reporting your activity to the credit bureaus in the past six months. A VantageScore, from FICO's biggest competitor, can be generated more quickly.
- Becoming an authorized user on a trusted adult’s credit card can help you take advantage of someone else’s long credit history and record of on-time payments without financial responsibility for the bill. If you are responsible for rent payments or other utility payments, you can enroll in a service that gives credit for on-time payments.

URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/calculator/auto-loan-refinance-calculator


Application Process:
- Next step: Apply for an auto refinance loan
- An auto refinance calculator is a helpful tool to estimate what you might save with refinancing — whether on your monthly payment, total loan cost or both. But keep in mind that factors unique to you, including your car’s age and mileage, contribute to the interest rate you’ll receive. Your actual savings could be more or less than what the calculator shows.
- The process for auto loan refinancing is much like when you applied for your original loan, and many lenders return a loan decision in a matter of minutes.
- At some point in the auto refinancing process, most lenders will request the following information, so you can prepare by gathering it ahead of time.
- Vehicle registration.
- Vehicle registration.
- A statement of loan payoff amount from your current lender.
- A statement of loan payoff amount from your current lender.
- If you pre-qualify with lenders to obtain rate estimates for the auto refinance calculator, you might opt to move forward with your best pre-qualified offer. Lenders may request additional information from you before approving the loan.
- If you’re still contemplating where to apply for an auto refinance loan, you have several options. Most banks and credit unions offer auto refinancing, and you can apply at a local branch or online to lenders outside of your area. Online aggregators that send your application to a network of lenders are another option.

- Regardless of where you apply, it’s a good idea to get offers from more than one lender to find your best auto refinance rate. Just make sure to submit all applications within a 14-day period, so hard credit inquiries are treated as one and have less of an impact on your credit scores.

Financial Tips:
- Here are some tips for making a meaningful comparison and, ultimately, a smart financial decision.
- Details about your current loan
- You’ll need information about the car loan you have now, specifically the remaining balance, interest rate and loan term (length in months). You can find this on your latest car loan statement or by calling your lender. Many lenders also provide it through an online account or app. If you don't have exact details, estimate as close as possible.
- Details about the new refinance loan
- For the new auto refinance loan, you'll need the amount you want to refinance, loan term and interest rate. Since you may still be deciding if you want to refinance, it’s likely you won’t have exact figures for a new loan. Here are a few ways you can come up with these numbers.
- Refinanced loan amount: Use the balance you still owe on your current auto loan. Again, this can be found on your loan statement, by contacting your lender or through an online account. Note that using the “payoff amount” is more accurate than current balance, because it includes any fees and interest that accrue until you pay off the loan.

Note that using the “payoff amount” is more accurate than current balance, because it includes any fees and interest that accrue until you pay off the loan.
- New loan term: You can try different terms in the auto refinance calculator. You may want to simply use the number of months remaining on your current loan. You can also go with fewer months than you now have remaining, which will enable you to pay off your loan sooner and pay less interest. A third option is to extend the loan term, which will lower your payment but increase your total interest cost. Going with a longer term can also lead to being upside-down on your car loan, which is owing more than your car is worth.

Going with a longer term can also lead to being upside-down on your car loan, which is owing more than your car is worth.
- New interest rate: Of course, your goal with refinancing is likely to find a lower interest rate. You can check auto refinance lenders and rates online to get an idea of the current market's rates. Another option is to apply for pre-qualification with several auto refinancing lenders. Auto loan pre-qualification isn’t loan approval, but it gives you an estimate of the APR you’ll qualify for.

- Reasons to consider refinancing an auto loan
- People refinance cars for many reasons, including simply to remove a co-borrower from a loan. However, if you’re using an auto refinance calculator, it’s likely that you want refinancing to improve your financial situation. Here are some times when an auto refinance loan might enable you to do just that.
- Interest rates have dropped: If auto loan rates in general fall lower than when you first got your car loan, refinancing could be an opportunity to take advantage of lower auto refinance rates. In the past few years, auto loan rates have climbed and remained high, but as of late 2024 they've started to fall.

In the past few years, auto loan rates have climbed and remained high, but as of late 2024 they've started to fall.
- Your credit has improved: If you had poor credit when you got your car loan, you may have a high interest rate. You might now qualify for a lower interest rate, if you’ve made consistent, on-time payments for 6 to 12 months. You can check your credit report and score for free through NerdWallet.

- You didn’t shop rates and took dealer financing: When you got your original loan, the dealership might have charged you a higher interest rate than you could have qualified for elsewhere — especially if it knew you weren’t comparing loan offers. But, with refinancing, you can still shop for a lower rate.

- Your current payment is too much: Refinancing for a longer term can reduce your monthly payment; however, you will pay more interest over the life of the loan. Still, it’s a better option than missing payments or facing repossession if you’re really struggling to make payments on time.

- Don’t sweat higher short-term rates. One lingering trend in the current rate environment is that five-year rates remain lower than shorter-term rates for national averages and high-yield CDs. Even though the best one-year CD rates are closer to 4%, remember that five-year CDs have longer periods to compound interest and can result in higher returns than one-year CDs, even if they have higher rates.

Financial Tips:
- There are ways to track your utilization and keep it low. For example, you can make multiple credit card payments over the course of the month so the lowest balance gets reported to the credit bureaus. You also can set alerts to get notified when your credit cards approach 30% of their limit.
- There are ways to track your utilization and keep it low. For example, you can make multiple credit card payments over the course of the month so the lowest balance gets reported to the credit bureaus. You also can set alerts to get notified when your credit cards approach 30% of their limit.
- Your credit utilization ratio is how much you owe on all your revolving accounts, such as credit cards, compared with your total available credit — expressed as a percentage. It's important because it's one of the biggest factors in your credit score.
- Good credit utilization follows the 30% rule
- NerdWallet suggests using no more than 30% of your limits, and less is better. People with the best credit scores often have a credit utilization number in the single digits.
- What is 100% credit utilization?
- Having 100% credit utilization means that you have used all your available credit. Charging too much on your cards, especially if you max them out, is associated with being a higher credit risk. That’s why running up your cards will lower your score.
- There are other ways you might accidentally reach that 100% credit utilization mark. Take this example: You have three credit cards. Card No. 1 has $5,000 of available credit, Card No. 2 has $2,000 and Card No. 3 has $3,000. You have maxed out Cards Nos. 1 and 2 and decide to close Card No. 3 since it has a $0 balance and you don’t use it often. Suddenly, your overall credit utilization jumps from 70% to 100%, risking a drop in your credit score and leaving you with no wiggle room for emergencies.
- » Want a credit bump? Here are 5 tips for lowering your credit utilization
- How to calculate your credit utilization ratio
- You can calculate credit utilization yourself using this formula:
- Add up the balances on all your credit cards.
- Add up the balances on all your credit cards.
- Add up the credit limits on all your cards.
- Add up the credit limits on all your cards.
- Divide the total balance by the total credit limit.
- Divide the total balance by the total credit limit.
- Multiply by 100 to see your credit utilization ratio as a percentage.
- Multiply by 100 to see your credit utilization ratio as a percentage.
- For example, say you have two credit cards, both carrying a $500 balance. One card has a $2,000 credit limit and the other a $3,000 credit limit. That works out to a credit card utilization of 20%.
- You can also use the credit utilization calculator below to calculate it for you, or sign up with NerdWallet to get a free weekly credit score update that shows your utilization.
- Use a credit utilization calculator
- There are two types of credit utilization ratios: per-card and overall. Per-card utilization measures how much of each card’s credit limit you’re using, while overall utilization takes all your cards and their limits into account.
- Enter the balance and credit limit for up to three cards in this calculator to see your per-card and overall utilization figures:
- » MORE: See more financial calculators from NerdWallet
- Both per card and overall utilization rates are important. Credit scores can take the ratio into account in both ways.
- Why that’s important to know: If you try to counteract the negative effects of a maxed-out credit card by opening a new card and keeping its balance at $0, the high utilization ratio on the maxed-out card still may hurt your score.
- If you avoid using more than 30% of the credit limit on any one card, the overall usage takes care of itself.
- » MORE FOR CANADIAN READERS: What's a good credit utilization ratio?
- How does credit utilization affect my credit score?
- Credit utilization is one of the top factors used to calculate your credit score, so it’s important to keep an eye on it. Paying your bills on time and in full can keep the balances on your credit cards low and, ideally, below that 30% threshold.
- You might have heard some people recommend that leaving a small balance on your credit cards each month helps your credit score. This is a myth. It’s best to pay your balance in full every month. Not only will you avoid paying interest but you’ll also keep your credit utilization low, which will help your credit score.
- Strategies for keeping your credit utilization low
- There are some things you can do to keep your credit utilization low.
- Make payments throughout the month to reduce your credit card balance. By paying a portion of your balance each week or every few weeks, it’s likely that your lowest balance will be reported to the credit bureaus. A lower balance means you’re using less of your available credit, which translates to a lower credit utilization score.

A lower balance means you’re using less of your available credit, which translates to a lower credit utilization score.
- Set alerts on your credit cards. Many cards offer alerts you can set for all kinds of things, including when you’ve used a certain portion of your available credit. Set that alert to notify you once you’re close to hitting 30% (or less) to stay on top of spending.

- Ask for a higher credit limit. Calling your lender to ask for a higher credit limit can be one way to provide some cushion while you pay down your balances and work toward a 30% or lower credit utilization. But, this works only if you commit to not overspending and using the newly available credit.

Application Process:
- Once we uncover your personalized matches, our team will consult you on the process moving forward.
- Types of business loans
- SBA loans. The United States Small Business Administration works with banks and other financial institutions to provide small-business loans that have low interest rates and long repayment terms. However, SBA loans are slow to fund and can be difficult to qualify for.
- Term loans. Term loans typically range from three to 24 months for a short-term loan and up to 10 years or longer for a long-term loan. These loans can be used for a variety of purposes, including working capital.
- Lines of credit. A business line of credit provides flexible access to cash. You get approved for a specific amount of credit and can draw from your line as needed. You only make payments and pay interest on the money you use.
- Equipment financing. Equipment financing is used to purchase equipment. Lenders often finance up to 100% of the value of the equipment. These loans are self-collateralizing, meaning the equipment itself serves as collateral for the loan.
- Commercial real estate loan. A commercial real estate loan is used to buy, build, refinance or renovate a commercial property, like a warehouse, office building or retail store. Standard commercial real estate loans work a lot like a personal mortgage, but tend to have shorter repayment terms and higher upfront costs.
- Alternative ways to finance your business
- If you don’t need a lot of money, business grants provide free money to startups and operating businesses — either by giving you a lump sum, or reimbursing you for certain expenses. They can be difficult to research and apply for, and grant amounts typically aren’t as high as loans, but it can be worth it if you’re able to get free money for your business, even in small amounts.
- If your business is newer, personal business loans are a good option if your business can’t qualify for traditional financing. Lenders consider your personal credit score and income instead of your business history.
- If you want a revolving source of capital, business credit cards can be easier to get than a small-business loan. Business credit cards tend to have relatively low credit limits, but you can earn rewards for your spending, such as cash back or travel points.
- If you have poor personal credit and lack collateral, invoice factoring and invoice financing both involve the use of unpaid customer invoices to access capital. With factoring, you sell the invoices to a factoring company that then collects the money from your customers. With invoice financing, the unpaid invoices serve as collateral on a cash advance. You still collect payment on the invoices from your customers, and then you pay back the loan.
- Best Small Business Loans
- How a Business Line of Credit Works and Where to Get It

Financial Tips:
- Annual percentage rate (APR). The total cost of borrowing money. It includes interest rate and fees, over the life of your loan. If you don’t know the loan’s APR, you can enter the interest rate here instead. If your lender gives a factor rate, you can calculate your interest rate by multiplying the factor rate by your total loan amount (see our example below).
- Calculate total interest: (Loan Amount × Factor Rate) − Loan Amount
- Calculate interest rate: ((Total Interest / Loan Amount) × (365 / Loan Term in Days)) × 100
- Total interest paid. The total amount a lender is charging you for a loan. If you repay the loan early, you might be able to save on interest — provided your lender doesn’t charge a prepayment penalty.
- Total payments. The sum of all payments made on the loan, including the amount you borrowed, plus interest and fees.
- Amortization schedule. This shows how much of your monthly (or annual) payments will go toward your principal and how much will go toward interest. As you continue to repay your loan over time, your monthly payment will remain the same, but your interest payments will get smaller and more of your payment will go toward your principal.
- Would I feel comfortable setting up automatic payments for the monthly amount of this loan?
- Consider total interest cost, not only the monthly payment. A lower monthly payment may mean more interest paid over the life of the loan, so compare both monthly payments and the total interest cost.

- Student loan refinance rates
- Private student loan interest rates can be fixed or variable and range from 3.95% to 9.99%. The rate you receive depends on factors such as credit history and income.
- If you opt to federally consolidate your loans instead of privately refinancing them, your interest rate will not necessarily decrease. Interest rates for Direct Consolidation Loans are the weighted average of interest rates for the loans you are consolidating, which could increase your interest rate slightly. The benefit is a fixed interest rate that will not change over time.
- Should I refinance my student loans?
- Refinancing student loans is usually best for those with strong credit and stable income, since this often results in better loan terms.
- Can you refinance federal student loans?
- You can refinance federal student loans into a private loan, but it means you'll forfeit federal benefits like income-driven repayment plans and eventual student loan forgiveness. If you want to keep your federal loans federal, consider consolidation with the Department of Education.
- Can you refinance private student loans?
- Private student loans can be refinanced, and interest rates are either fixed or variable. The ideal time to refinance your student loans is when you can get a lower rate and commit to the monthly repayments. Borrowers with limited credit history may not qualify for a lower rate through private student loan refinancing.

The rate will not increase more than once per month. The maximum rate for your loan is 8.95% if your loan term is 10 years or less. For loan terms of more than 10 years to 15 years, the interest rate will never exceed 9.95%. For loan terms over 15 years, the interest rate will never exceed 11.95%. Please note, we are not able to offer variable rate loans in AK, IL, MN, NH, OH, TN, and TX.

- What is student loan refinancing?
- Student loan refinancing takes multiple loans and combines them into a new loan with a private lender such as a bank or online lender. The new servicer will pay off your old debt and typically offer a lower interest rate or longer term with smaller monthly payments — saving you money or making your payments more manageable. You can refinance federal and private student loan debt into one new private loan.

Eligibility Criteria:
- Whether you personally can refinance will depend on whether you and your vehicle meet lender requirements for refinancing a car. Eligibility requirements can vary from lender to lender — another reason to shop more than one auto refinancing lender.
- As with any auto loan, approval of your auto refinancing loan and the interest rate you receive will depend on factors like your credit score, loan payment history and debt-to-income ratio. Also some lenders will have restrictions on vehicle age and mileage, or they may have time requirements for how soon you can refinance after getting the original loan.
- Should you refinance your car loan?
- Borrowers refinance auto loans for different reasons, with the most common being reducing an auto loan rate to save money. But you may have other reasons for wanting to refinance a car, such as changing the loan length or removing a co-borrower from the current loan.
- Here are some situations when it could make sense to refinance your car:
- If your credit has improved: If you’ve made consistent, on-time payments for 6 to 12 months since getting your car loan, and the lender has been reporting these payments to the credit bureaus, you might now qualify for a lower interest rate.
- If your credit has improved: If you’ve made consistent, on-time payments for 6 to 12 months since getting your car loan, and the lender has been reporting these payments to the credit bureaus, you might now qualify for a lower interest rate.
- If a car dealer marked up your interest rate: When you got your original loan, the car dealer might have charged you a higher interest rate than you could have qualified for elsewhere — and can still qualify for with refinancing.

Application Process:
- If you can’t keep up with payments: Refinancing to extend the length of the loan can lower your car payments, but don’t take this step lightly. Extending the loan term means you will pay more interest and more in total over the life of the loan, but that’s still a better option than missing payments or facing repossession.

- If interest rates drop: If auto loan rates in general fall lower than when you first got your car loan, refinancing could be an opportunity to take advantage of lower auto refinance rates.

- What are current auto refinance rates?
- Auto refinance rates vary by lender and borrower, but you can get a general idea about rates in the current market. NerdWallet regularly requests auto refinance rates (both the highest and lowest possible) from the lenders and aggregators that we review. You can find the auto refinance rates provided by each lender and aggregator as part of its review.
- In general, auto loan rates have increased over the past two years, reaching their highest level in more than two decades. With the Federal Reserve keeping the federal funds rate elevated to curb inflation, auto loan rates also remained high and refinancing to a lower rate wasn’t likely.
- The good news is that interest rates, including auto loan rates, are expected to start declining in late 2024. This will probably be a slight easing of rates over time, so at what point will auto loan rates drop enough to make refinancing attractive again? The answer to that question depends on each borrower’s current loan rate.
- As rates change, you can use an auto loan refinance calculator to compare your existing auto loan with a new one. Input APRs for both loans, along with the loan terms, to see at what APR your monthly savings would be enough to make refinancing a good idea.

- What’s the process for refinancing a car loan?
- Completing the loan application to refinance a car is usually pretty simple, but it’s a good idea to do some preparation to ensure auto loan refinancing makes sense for you.
- Review details about your existing loan. If you aren’t certain of your current APR, determine that. Find out how many months are left on the loan and the payoff amount. You will need this information as well, if you proceed with applying for an auto refinancing loan.

- Estimate your car’s value. Use resources like Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds to figure what your vehicle is worth. If you owe more on the loan than the car’s value, called having negative equity, you may have difficulty refinancing.

- Apply to lenders that offer pre-qualification. If you decide to pursue auto refinancing, look for lenders that offer pre-qualification with a soft credit check, which won’t affect your credit score. You’ll get pre-qualified loan offers with rate, term and payment estimates, but know that details can change as you move forward and a hard credit inquiry is done.

- Compare and select an auto refinancing lender. An auto loan refinancing calculator can help you compare lender offers with your current loan, including seeing how much a lower APR could save you. When choosing a lender, also compare fees and repayment terms. When you move forward with a lender, expect a hard credit inquiry which may cause a temporary drop in your credit scores

- Decide on the length of your new loan. Your new loan term can be the number of months remaining on your current loan, or you can shorten or extend it. A longer term can lower your monthly payment, but you’ll pay more interest over the life of the loan and could become upside-down on your loan. Common auto refinancing terms range from 24 to 84 months, but this can vary by lender.

- Once approved, finalize paperwork and pay off the old loan. Your new auto refinance loan provides funds to pay off and replace your current loan. In most cases, your refinance lender will pay off the existing loan, and you start making monthly, and hopefully lower, payments on the new loan.

- Transfer the car’s title. The final step when refinancing is having a new car title issued to replace the lienholder (lender that has your loan) with the new lender. Many lenders will handle the title transfer for you. In some states, you may also need to re-register the car.

- How soon can you refinance a car loan?
- The best time to refinance a car is when auto loan rates drop, and you can get a better loan — but that’s the simple answer. Here are a few timing considerations for when you can and should refinance a car loan.
- Refinancing a car loan right away: Some lenders will refinance an auto loan as soon as you can provide information about your existing loan and lender. If you settled for an extremely high auto loan rate to escape a dealership, and you have good credit (FICO score of 690 and up), then refinancing to a lower rate as soon as possible may be a good idea.
- Waiting to refinance an auto loan: Some lenders have a waiting period of several months before they’ll refinance an auto loan. And, if you have a high auto loan APR because of poor credit, choosing to wait six to 12 months before refinancing can improve your chances of getting a better loan. You generally need a history of six to 12 months of on-time payments, with no new negative items on your credit report, to make auto refinancing worthwhile or even possible with some lenders.
- Who are the best auto loan refinance lenders?
- The best place to refinance your car may be different than the “best” for another borrower. Applying to several auto refinance lenders and comparing offers will give you the best chance of finding the lowest auto refinance rates with the shortest term for which you can qualify.
- Here are some things to think about when you’re considering where to apply for an auto refinance loan.
- NerdWallet's review process surveys companies that offer any combination of new car purchase loans, used car purchase loans, auto refinance loans (traditional and/or cash-out) and lease buyout loans. These companies include direct lenders and aggregators; the latter group doesn't have in-house loan products but matches borrowers to third-party lenders within a network. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of providers to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgements on which ones will best meet your needs. We adhere to strict guidelines for editorial integrity.
- To receive a star rating, a provider must respond to NerdWallet’s annual auto loans survey. Star ratings are then assessed from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars).

- Typically, the higher your credit scores and the stronger your credit history, the more lender choices you’ll have for lower auto refinancing rates.
- Can you refinance a car loan with bad credit?
- Refinancing an auto loan when you have bad credit can be difficult, but it might still be possible. Some lenders have minimum credit score requirements as low as 500. NerdWallet’s reviews of auto loan refinancing lenders show the minimum credit score for most.
- But if your low credit score hasn't improved since getting your original loan, you’re likely to have trouble finding a lender willing to refinance to a lower rate. If you’re having trouble making car payments, talk to your current lender right away (before missing any payments). Some lenders have options to assist you that don’t require refinancing.
- When is auto loan refinancing not a good idea?
- Auto loan financing has many benefits, if in fact it enables you to end up with a better auto loan and improve your financial situation. But there are times when refinancing your car may not be a good idea. Here are a few examples:
- You can’t find a significantly better interest rate: If interest rates haven’t dropped much since you got your original loan, or your credit hasn’t improved, you might not find a rate that’s much better than what you currently have. A good rule of thumb: If you can lower your current auto loan rate by 1% or more, you’re likely to save enough in interest over the life of the loan to make refinancing worthwhile.
- You can’t find a significantly better interest rate: If interest rates haven’t dropped much since you got your original loan, or your credit hasn’t improved, you might not find a rate that’s much better than what you currently have. A good rule of thumb: If you can lower your current auto loan rate by 1% or more, you’re likely to save enough in interest over the life of the loan to make refinancing worthwhile.
- A lower interest rate or payment requires a much longer loan term: A lower rate and payment might look good on paper, but it can cost you much more in interest overall when you extend the loan term. During that time your car continues to lose value, meaning you could end up owing more than the car is worth.

During that time your car continues to lose value, meaning you could end up owing more than the car is worth.
- You’ll pay more in fees than you’ll save: Read the fine print to see what you’re actually paying to refinance. Some lenders and aggregators charge fees under a variety of names — such as origination, application and document fees — that would eat into your expected savings from refinancing.

- What will it cost to refinance my car loan?Most auto loans carry no prepayment penalty, so you most likely won't have any fees associated with ending your original loan. Some lenders do have application fees, so ask your auto refinancing lender about that. Also, some states require you to re-register the vehicle, so you could have registration or title transfer fees. Ask your local DMV about the requirements and costs in your state.

Ask your local DMV about the requirements and costs in your state.
- Can I refinance if I owe more than my car is worth?When you finance a car, whether you're buying or refinancing, the vehicle is collateral for the loan. Some lenders want a loan to be fully secured and won't provide a loan for more than 100% of the car's value. This is called the “loan-to-value” ratio or LTV. Other lenders make loans for more than 100% LTV, but usually only if the borrower has good credit. If you can refinance your upside-down car loan, it may be a way to get right-side up faster.

- Can I get cash back when I refinance my car?If your car is worth substantially more than you owe on it, some lenders allow what is known as cash-out auto refinancing. You borrow more than you owe on your current loan, pay off that lender and take the remainder in cash.Cash-out auto refinancing could make sense, for example, if you need money for an emergency. Interest rates for cash-out refinancing may be lower than what you would pay on a credit card or personal loan, because the loan is secured by your car.But borrowing against your car comes with risks. If your car is totaled or you eventually want to sell it, you might not receive enough from insurance or the buyer to pay off your loan balance. You would then be responsible for paying the remainder of the loan.

- Will I pay prepayment penalties to pay off my loan early?Before refinancing, ask your current lender if there’s a prepayment penalty to pay off your loan early. The odds are that there won’t be. Prepayment penalties used to be more common than they are today. Of the 30 financial companies surveyed by NerdWallet for auto loan reviews, all responded that they do not charge prepayment penalties.

- 🤓 Nerdy Tip
- Figure out what you can qualify for. The better your personal credit, the more business credit card options you’ll have. If your FICO score is below 690, focus on business credit cards for fair credit (FICO scores typically from 630 to 689) or business credit cards for bad credit (FICO scores below 630).
- Weigh the annual fee against potential rewards. Some credit cards charge annual fees, but those cards also tend to offer more generous rewards on travel or other types of spending. If the rewards outweigh that cost, paying a fee may be worth it (plus, the annual fee may be tax deductible). But you can also choose from a number of business credit cards with no annual fee so your new business has one less expense.
- Look for a long intro period. A business credit card with a 0% APR introductory offer can help you pay off startup expenses over time — 12 or more billing cycles, in some cases — without owing interest on the balance you roll over.
- Find rewards that match your spending. Some cash-back business credit cards offer a flat rewards rate on all your company’s spending, regardless of what you’re buying. Others offer higher rewards rates in categories like travel or gas — or on spending with specific companies, like Amazon or Lowe’s. Choose a card that’s likely to align with your purchasing patterns.
- Consider the cards already in your wallet. Many business credit cards let you combine rewards from the same issuer —  including points earned on personal cards — and potentially increase the redemption value. If you already have the Chase Freedom Unlimited® or Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card, for instance, you can combine points with the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card to maximize your rewards.
- Can new businesses get business credit cards?
- Why should startups use business credit cards?
- Access to financing. New businesses generally don’t qualify for business loans due to their lack of a track record. Business credit cards offer startup funding that can help you cover costs while you build revenue. Credit cards are one of the most expensive forms of financing due to their high interest rates, though, so look for a 0% intro APR period if you want to spread out big expenses.
- Business credit history. In general, card issuers report the use of a business credit card (and the payment of your bill — whether on time or late) to business credit bureaus, helping to create a credit profile specific to your business. Your business credit score can help you qualify for other types of financing in the future.
- Employee cards. Most business credit cards issue employee cards for free. Usually, you can control when and where employees use those cards — which can be a good way to empower your employees to make business purchases without putting your cash at risk.
- Rewards for spending. New businesses often face a number of startup costs. A business credit card can earn you cash back or points for those purchases you have to make anyway. Some cards even offer bonus categories with bigger rewards on expenses like office supplies or advertising that you may need to invest in to get up and running.
- Credit card perks. In addition to rewards, many credit cards come with perks like rental car insurance and discounts at select vendors.

Application Process:
- Hands-on testing of the account funding process, provider websites and stock trading platforms.
- Dozens of objective ratings rubrics and strict guidelines to maintain editorial integrity.
- The star ratings below represent each online brokerage's overall score. Our reviewers — who are full-time investing writers and editors on NerdWallet’s content team — spend months researching brokerage accounts, extensively testing each broker's stock trading platforms through real accounts we open and fund to place trades. That way, we’re able to report on every aspect of the user experience, from how long it takes to fund a new brokerage account — and how easy to the process is — to what it's like to trade stocks and other investments. We also compare online broker fees, tools, research options, customer service, educational content and more.
- Read our detailed methodologyNerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and rates the largest U.S. brokerage firms by assets under management, along with emerging industry players. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of providers to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgements on which one will best meet your needs. We collect data directly from providers through detailed questionnaires, and conduct first-hand testing and observation through provider demonstrations. The questionnaire answers, combined with demonstrations, interviews of personnel at the providers and our specialists’ hands-on research, fuel our proprietary assessment process that scores each provider’s performance across more than 20 factors. We score each online broker against a set of criteria that factors in both the features offered and the actual user experience of using those features. This includes how easy it is to sign up for and fund a new account. Note that a broker may score highly for the stock trading platforms, tools or research it offers, but low for the experience of actually using those features. This means a broker can offer an advanced stock trading platform, but if it is clunky to use or the process of opening an account is unnecessarily arduous, that will be reflected in their score.The final output produces star ratings from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars). For more details about the categories considered when rating brokers and our process, read our full methodology.

- Why we picked it: Webull will appeal to the mobile-first generation of casual investors with its slick interface for desktop and mobile apps. The brokerage also delivers an impressive array of tools for active traders and a wide investment selection, including stocks (plus fractional shares), options, ETFs, commodities and futures.
- Why we picked it: SoFi Active Investing is an good choice for investors who also utilize SoFi's other offerings, like its bank or loan accounts. But the broker offers a few things that are relatively rare in the industry, including IPO access and insight into the investment holdings of well-known traders.
- Why we picked it: Our testers found Moomoo to have one of the smoothest account signup processes of any broker we tested. The trading experience also impressed us, and strikes a balance between a sleek, approachable interface and robust features that will appeal to advanced traders. Users agree, as the app is highly rated across app stores.
- If you’re new to investing, it may be best to look for a brokerage that offers free educational resources, such as live webinars, thorough how-to guides, video tutorials, glossaries and more.
- Switching to a new broker is quick and easy, and in most cases, the entire process can be handled online.
- Here's a quick three-step process to transfer your investments to a new online broker:
- Find your most recent brokerage account statement, then open an account at the new broker. You can do this online, and you'll need to supply details like your address, income, birthday and Social Security number.
- Find your most recent brokerage account statement, then open an account at the new broker. You can do this online, and you'll need to supply details like your address, income, birthday and Social Security number.
- Initiate the transfer process through the new broker. You'll likely be asked to fill out a form online that initiates an ACAT, or Automated Customer Account Transfer. This is where you'll need your brokerage account statement — you'll have to supply things like your old account number. Your new online broker will use that information to confirm that your investments can be transferred in-kind, which means you don't have to sell them. This is often the case with most stocks, ETFs and mutual funds. If the new brokerage doesn't support one of your investments, you can sell it and transfer the cash instead.

This is often the case with most stocks, ETFs and mutual funds. If the new brokerage doesn't support one of your investments, you can sell it and transfer the cash instead.
- Another option for investing smaller amounts of money is exchange-traded funds. ETFs are essentially mutual funds that are bought and sold just like individual stocks on a stock market exchange. Like mutual funds, each ETF contains a basket of stocks (sometimes hundreds) that adhere to particular criteria (e.g., shares of companies that are part of a stock market index like the S&P 500). Unlike mutual funds, which can have high investment minimums, investors can purchase as little as one share of an ETF at a time (some brokers even offer fractional shares of ETFs, too). All of the online brokers on our list offer ETFs.

Financial Tips:
- Why we picked it: Tastytrade targets advanced traders, and has the platform functionality to deliver — there are pre-built options strategies, a Follow Feed that allows you to track fellow investors' trades and the capability to view multiple charts at once. Options traders will appreciate tastytrade's contract fees, which work out to be lower than most brokers. And tastytrade's mobile app earned a rare five-star rating from us.
- "But if you are after a specific feature — say, mobile trading or a clean, beginner-friendly UX — you may want to dig deeper into other options, like Moomoo, Robinhood or SoFi. It's also OK to have multiple brokerage accounts for different purposes if you find that's the best fit for you."
- Nerdy Tip
- Traditional brokerage accounts are sometimes called taxable accounts, because the capital gains in your account — the investment income — may be taxable each year.
- Your account choices boil down to a taxable brokerage account or a tax-favored retirement account, such as an IRA. Part of the decision depends on what you're investing for. Retirement accounts are intended for retirement, and there can be penalties if you take your money out too early. (If you're new to this, we’ve got you covered in our guide to IRAs.) If you're investing for a shorter-term goal, generally a brokerage account will be best.

- 2. Use the FHFA House Price Index Calculator
- Another alternative for getting a quick home value estimate is the Federal Housing Financing Agency's house price index (HPI) calculator.
- The tool uses the “repeat sales” technique. Equipped with millions of mortgage transactions gathered since the 1970s, the FHFA tracks a house’s change in value from one sale to the next. Then it uses this information to estimate how values fluctuate in a given market.
- Keep in mind the HPI calculator looks at conforming home mortgages (loans less than $766,550 and up to $1,149,825 in high-cost areas) and isn’t adjusted seasonally or for inflation.

- Lenders require a home appraisal before they’ll approve a mortgage, but as a property owner, you can hire an appraiser to estimate home value at any time. Among other things, appraisers evaluate:
- Although more thorough than an online estimate, appraisals aren't foolproof. If you're applying for a mortgage and think the appraiser was unfair or made a mistake, you can file for a "reconsideration of value" with the lender.

- A bank interest calculator tallies how much interest you can earn over time in your savings account. These calculators will usually show you the total balance after compounding.
- You can calculate the amount of simple interest your account earns by multiplying the account balance by the interest rate for a select time period. To calculate compound interest, you’ll need to add up interest earned over time. You can do that by adjusting the compound frequency in this savings calculator.
- Focus on any amount that you can save consistently. Overall, there is no one answer for how much you should have in savings, but an ideal target for an emergency fund is enough to cover three to six months' worth of basic expenses. If you’re able to save 20% of your take-home income each month, for example, you may be well on your way. But it’s more important to be consistent, even if it means saving a smaller amount each month. With time, you can still reach your savings goal.
- If you start with zero and put away $135 a month (about $33.75 a week) in a savings account that compounds monthly and earns a 5% annual interest rate, you would save more than $5,200 in three years. Use this savings calculator to compare other contribution amounts and yields.

Application Process:
- Chanelle Bessette is a personal finance writer at NerdWallet covering banking. She specializes in checking and cash management accounts. Read moreabout the author

Financial Tips:
- If you decide to go with SoFi, you’ll want to make sure to meet the direct deposit requirements to earn the maximum interest rate and get overdraft protection. A potential drawback to banking with SoFi is that if you want to make a cash deposit, you’ll have to go to a Green Dot retail location and pay a fee of up to $4.95 for each deposit. That might not be an issue if you don’t usually handle cash, but if you want to deposit cash regularly — like if you work a tip-based job, for example — those fees could add up quickly.
- The Xtraordinary Checking account earns an APY as high as 1.75% for balances of up to $25,000. The credit union also gives up to $25 per month in rebates for out-of-network domestic ATM fees. In order to get these benefits, customers must meet certain criteria, including opting in for paperless statements and meeting some spending and deposit requirements. Customers need to either make 15 debit card transactions or spend at least $400.  If the requirements aren’t met, you won’t earn interest that month. If you can handle those extra requirements, you can earn a pretty solid interest rate.
- American Express Rewards Checking is available to American Express customers who have had a consumer credit card for at least 35 days. The account has a 1.00% APY interest rate and no monthly fees or minimum deposit requirements. Notably, American Express doesn’t have any requirements for customers to earn interest, but the requirement that new banking customers be credit card customers is a rare prerequisite.
- To earn interest, customers have to meet some requirements and they have a choice between two different sets. The first option includes receiving qualifying direct deposits of more than $1,500 total by the 25th of the month and maintaining an average daily balance of $1,500 in their account. The alternative option involves receiving qualifying deposits (such as online transfers or checks) of at least $5,000 total by the 25th of the month and maintaining an average daily balance of more than $5,000. Fulfilling one set of requirements will also earn them a very high rate on Axos ONE Savings.
- Zynlo Bank customers can earn 2.00% APY on their spending account on any balance of a penny or more, which is a relatively high interest rate with no requirements to earn that rate. There’s a $10 minimum opening deposit for the account and no monthly fee. Zynlo is part of the Allpoint network, so customers can access more than 55,000 free ATMs. A large, free ATM network is a beneficial feature when you primarily bank online.
- Upgrade gives customers 2% cash back — up to a maximum of $500 per year — on qualified purchases as long as they make at least $1,000 in direct deposits per month. If they don’t meet the direct deposit requirement, customers will earn 1% cash back. Qualified purchases include drug stores, restaurants, gas stations and other everyday places. After customers earn $500 in rewards, they will earn 1% cash back for the rest of the year on everyday purchases. This account is great for cash back, but you’ll have to do a lot of debit card spending to optimize your rewards. You may want to analyze the kinds of rewards that you could earn with a credit card versus this debit card to ensure you’re earning the most cash back possible.
- Requirements to open a checking account
- Prepaid debit cards. Prepaid debit cards are like regular debit cards, but instead of being linked to a checking account, you load it with cash in advance. This helps you avoid overdraft fees because you can only spend the amount that you’ve loaded onto the card. It doesn’t require any kind of credit check, so they’re easy to get.
- Usually there won’t be many downsides to keeping multiple checking accounts open as long as you can meet the requirements of those accounts to avoid fees.
- There are also several accounts that offer bonuses and promotions for opening an account, so if you’re able to juggle the requirements, you could make some extra cash by opening multiple accounts. You also may want to consider opening multiple checking accounts at different institutions for different uses, such as keeping an account at a provider that works well for international travel if you go out of the country a lot, or keeping a checking account open with the bank that handles your mortgage for faster payment transfers.
- We took a close look at over 100 financial institutions and financial service providers, including the largest U.S. banks based on assets, internet search traffic and other factors; the nation’s largest credit unions, based on assets and membership; and other notable and/or emerging players in the industry.

- FHA loan preapproval: What you need
- To get preapproved for an FHA loan, you need to meet the lender’s requirements. If you qualify, many lenders — including those on our list — make it easy to get preapproved online. Just like any mortgage preapproval, you’ll need to provide details about your employment and finances.
- Some lenders may offer a bit more flexibility. But in general, you'll need to meet these requirements to qualify for an FHA loan:
- A credit score between 500 and 579 with a 10% down payment.
- A credit score between 500 and 579 with a 10% down payment.
- A credit score of at least 580 for the lowest FHA down payment of 3.5%.
- A credit score of at least 580 for the lowest FHA down payment of 3.5%.
- A debt-to-income ratio of 50% or lower.
- A debt-to-income ratio of 50% or lower.
- Having easier requirements means that FHA loans come with some additional costs. You’ll need to pay FHA closing costs, which include an upfront payment of 2%-6% of the loan amount. FHA mortgage insurance is also required, with both an upfront fee and monthly payments. If your down payment is less than 10%, you'll have to pay FHA mortgage insurance for the life of the loan.
- Nerdy Tip
- You might need a higher credit score than the minimum requirements to get an FHA loan. That’s because FHA-approved lenders set their own standards, which can be stricter. If you have credit challenges, take a look at our list of the best home loans for bad credit to explore more options.
- » MORE: FHA loan requirements
- Where to get an FHA loan
- To find the lowest interest rate and save money on your loan, try to get preapproved by at least three lenders. You can start with the lenders we list here. If you're looking for an FHA lender near you, check out the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's searchable list of approved FHA lenders.
- » MORE: How to choose a mortgage lender
- Are FHA loans only for first-time home buyers?
- You do not need to be a first-time home buyer to use an FHA loan. Lower minimum credit score and down payment requirements make FHA loans attractive to first-time home buyers, but current homeowners are eligible, too.
- Can you get an FHA loan if you have student loans?
- You can get an FHA loan if you have student loan debt, as long as you meet FHA debt-to-income requirements. If your payments are currently deferred or in forbearance, your lender will consider your "monthly obligation" to be 0.5% of your total student loan balance.

- Dozens of objective ratings rubrics, and strict guidelines to maintain editorial integrity.
- NerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and ranks companies that provide financial planning services online or connect users to a financial advisor. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of providers to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgements on which ones will best meet your needs. We adhere to strict guidelines for editorial integrity.
- We collect data directly from providers through detailed questionnaires, and conduct first-hand testing and observation through provider demonstrations. The questionnaire answers, combined with demonstrations, interviews of personnel at the providers and our specialists’ hands-on research, fuel our proprietary assessment process that scores each provider’s performance across more than 20 factors. The final output produces star ratings from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars).

Financial Tips:
- 2. What services you need. Maybe you just want help picking investments, or maybe you need advice on more advanced topics, like estate planning or insurance needs. These requirements will help you choose what type of financial advisor you need — typically, a robo-advisor is a good fit for investment management, but you'll need a financial advisor for advanced planning. (View our picks for the best robo-advisors.)
- 3. Whether you want in-person or online advice. If you don’t mind meeting with your advisor virtually, you'll often save money with an online service. These services also typically have lower account minimum requirements than traditional investment advisors. No matter what option you choose, it's always important to check qualifications and make sure they follow a fiduciary standard, which means your needs come first.
- These services offer unlimited access to a team of financial advisors — which means you may work with a different financial advisor each time. That generally comes at a lower cost, but you'll still be able to speak to an advisor and receive guidance as needed. Some of these advisors, including Vanguard, offer a dedicated advisor for clients who meet minimum investment requirements.
- If you find taking care of your finances and planning for the future to be overwhelming, a financial advisor can certainly help. If you feel confident investing your money, you may not need one.
- While financial advisors aren’t for everyone, they can help you navigate the tricky and often confusing waters of how to organize your finances. If you recently had a big life change (you got married, had a child, lost a family member), it can be helpful to work with a financial advisor to help you understand your new financial landscape.
- Financial advisors are a larger category of individuals who help people manage their finances. A certified financial planner has gone through extensive training, taken an exam and is legally obligated to act in their client’s best interest. It is important when you are looking for a financial advisor to thoroughly vet them, no matter what they call themselves.
- A financial advisor’s value depends on what they bring to your financial life. If you don’t have a lot of assets to manage, it might be better to try to manage them yourself or use a robo-advisor. As your assets grow and become more complicated — maybe you own a house, have an investment portfolio and are trying to pay off debt — it can be worthwhile to seek help from either a traditional or online advisor.

- Medical loss ratio (the percentage of premiums spent for member benefits).
- Because Medigap plans are standardized, you can get precisely the same Medicare benefits from any company offering the plan. So when you shop, keep these considerations in mind to find the best policy to fit your needs:
- NerdWallet’s Medicare Supplement Insurance (Medigap) ratings are based on pricing, discounts, plan types offered, complaint data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, consumer experience, additional perks and benefits, and more. To calculate each health insurance company's rating, we adjusted the scores to a curved 5-point scale, rounded to the nearest half star.
- NerdWallet reviewed 15 Medicare Supplement Insurance companies based on highest enrollment and greatest online search volume. At the national level, our scored reviews include companies covering about two-thirds of all Medigap beneficiaries. At the state level, our research includes at least one of the two largest Medigap insurance companies in 48 of the 50 states, plus Washington, D.C.
- These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best coverage and rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our editorial guidelines and full ratings methodology for Medicare Supplement Insurance.
- We examined complaints received by state insurance regulators and reported to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. To assess how insurers compare to one another, the NAIC calculates a complaint index each year for each subsidiary, measuring its share of total complaints relative to its size, or share of total premiums in the industry. To evaluate a company’s complaint history, we calculated a similar index for each insurance company, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary. We score companies based on this index of how many complaints the company receives relative to its market share. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC.

- Unless your loans are subsidized by the federal government, interest will accrue while you’re in school, during your grace period and during periods of student loan deferment and forbearance. That interest capitalizes when repayment begins, which means it is added to your principal loan amount. You’ll wind up paying interest on a larger amount, increasing the amount you pay over time.

Application Process:
- Actual rate and available repayment terms will vary based on your income. Fixed rates range from 4.54% APR to 10.14% APR (excludes 0.25% Auto Pay discount). Variable rates range from 6.13% APR to 10.24% APR (excludes 0.25% Auto Pay discount). Earnest variable interest rate student loan refinance loans are based on a publicly available index, the 30-day Average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The variable rate is based on the rate published on the 25th day, or the next business day, of the preceding calendar month, rounded to the nearest hundredth of a percent. The rate will not increase more than once per month. The maximum rate for your loan is 8.95% if your loan term is 10 years or less. For loan terms of more than 10 years to 15 years, the interest rate will never exceed 9.95%. For loan terms over 15 years, the interest rate will never exceed 11.95%. Please note, we are not able to offer variable rate loans in AK, IL, MN, NH, OH, TN, and TX. Our lowest rates are only available for our most credit qualified borrowers and contain our .25% auto pay discount from a checking or savings account.

- Splash Financial Student Loan Refinance
- Consider making monthly interest-only student loan payments while you’re in school, during your grace period or during a forbearance to avoid capitalization. Or, make a lump-sum interest payment before your six-month student loan grace period ends. It won’t directly speed up the payoff process, but it will mean you have a smaller balance to get rid of once repayment formally begins.
- The government automatically puts federal student loan borrowers on the 10-year standard repayment plan, unless you choose differently. If you can’t make extra payments, the fastest way to pay off federal loans is to stay on that standard repayment plan. It splits up your total debt (plus interest) into 120 monthly installments spread over 10 years.
- The federal government also offers income-driven repayment (IDR) plans, which can lower your monthly payment based on your income. However, IDR plans can also extend the payoff timeline up to 20 or 25 years (depending on your loan type), at which point your remaining debt may be forgiven. You can also consolidate student loans, which stretches repayment to a maximum of 30 years.
- If you can avoid these options and stick with the standard plan, it will mean a quicker road to being debt-free — but you might end up with hefty monthly payments.
- Use the government’s loan simulator to estimate your monthly payments and the amount you’ll pay overall on different repayment plans.
- 6. Refinance if you have good credit, a steady job and private loans
- Refinancing student loans can help you pay off student loans faster without making extra payments. This process replaces multiple federal or private student loans with a single private loan, ideally at a lower interest rate. To speed up repayment, choose a new loan term that’s less than what's left on your current loans.
- Opting for a shorter term may increase your monthly payment. But, it could help you pay the debt faster and save money on interest. For example, refinancing a $50,000 student loan with an 8.5% interest rate and 10-year term to 6% interest on a seven-year term would save you roughly $13,000 — but your monthly payment would increase by about $110.
- » MORE: Best refinance lenders for paying off student loans fast
- You’re a good candidate for refinancing if you already have private loans, a credit score at least in the high 600s, a steady, high income and a debt-to-income ratio below 50%.
- Think twice before refinancing federal student loans. You’ll lose access to IDR plans and federal student loan forgiveness programs, like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. You’ll also forfeit payment relief if you lose your job and other borrower protections which private borrowers can’t access. Once you refinance, your student loans permanently become private; there’s no way to turn them back into federal loans.

- If you get a raise, a student loan refinance bonus or another financial windfall, try to allocate at least a portion of it to your student loans.
- You can also look to your employer. Find out if your employer offers a student loan repayment program as an employee benefit and ask how to enroll.
- Start a side hustle to increase your income and pay off student loans faster. Sell items like clothing, unused gift cards or photos; rent out your spare room, parking spot or car; or use your skills to freelance or consult on the side.
- The fastest way to pay off student loans could include paying interest while in school, using autopay and making bi-weekly payments. If you can make extra payments toward the principal, that will speed up your debt-free date even more. You can also consider refinancing to potentially lower your interest rate and shorten the repayment term.

Financial Tips:
- Instead, instruct your servicer — either online, by phone or by mail — to apply overpayments to your principal balance and to keep next month’s due date as planned. If you have multiple loans with different interest rates, pay off the higher-interest loans first.
- You can make an additional payment at any point in the month, or you can make a lump-sum student loan payment on the due date. Either strategy can save you money.
- For example, let’s say you owe $10,000 with a 4.5% interest rate. By paying an extra $100 every month on a standard 10-year repayment plan, you’d be debt-free about five and a half years ahead of schedule.
- Use a student loan payoff calculator to see how fast you could get rid of your loans with extra payments and how much money in interest you’d save.
- Signing up for autopay is a way to lower your student loan interest rate so that more of your money goes toward your principal balance.
- Federal student loan servicers offer a quarter-point interest rate discount if you let them automatically deduct payments from your bank account. Many private lenders offer an auto-pay deduction as well.
- The savings from this discount will likely be minimal — dropping a $10,000 loan's interest rate from 4.50% to 4.25% would save you about $144 overall, based on a 10-year repayment plan. But when combined with some of the other strategies, it can still help you pay off student loans fast.
- » MORE: How to pay off parent PLUS loans faster
- Instead of making one full monthly student loan payment, you can pay half your bill every two weeks. This is called a “biweekly” payment.
- You’ll end up making an extra payment each year, shaving time off your repayment schedule and dollars off your interest costs. Use a biweekly student loan payment calculator to see how much time and money you can save.
- Earnest Student Loan Refinance

URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/finance/tracking-monthly-expenses


Application Process:
- For the 50/30/20 budget, divide your net income into three categories: 50% for needs, including minimum payments on debt; 30% for wants; and 20% for savings and debt paydown beyond minimums.
- Sorting your expenses into needs and wants can help you organize your budget and prioritize spending, especially if you need to cut costs to make room for savings or debt repayment. Here is a breakdown of each category in the 50/30/20 budget.
- Housing: Mortgage or rent; homeowners or renters insurance; property tax (if not already in the mortgage payment).
- Housing: Mortgage or rent; homeowners or renters insurance; property tax (if not already in the mortgage payment).
- Minimum payments on debt: credit cards; student loans; other loans.
- Minimum payments on debt: credit cards; student loans; other loans.
- Savings and debt repayment
- This is the money you’re putting toward your retirement, emergency fund and other savings, and using to pay down high-interest credit card and payday loans. It also includes anything over the minimum payment on other debts, such as your student loans and mortgage. In the 50/30/20 budget, this should account for 20% of your income:
- Extra debt payments on credit cards, mortgage, student loans, etc.
- Extra debt payments on credit cards, mortgage, student loans, etc.
- If you pay off your credit cards in full each month, classify the expenses according to what you buy — groceries under needs, for example. However, if you maintain a balance and are accruing interest and fees, list payments beyond the minimum under debt repayment.
- Consider using a budget app to track your expenses and save time. Budgeting apps are designed for on-the-go money management. They let you allocate a certain amount of spendable income each month, depending on what you’re taking in, and what you’re paying out.

Eligibility Criteria:
- The lender. Bank small-business loans typically have the lowest rates but tough qualifications. Online lenders have looser eligibility requirements but cost more: Interest rates on some types of online business loans can range from 6% to 99%.
- The loan type. Lenders offer many types of small-business loans, and rates vary by product. The best deal is often on loans backed by the U.S. Small Business Administration. SBA loan rates range from 10.5% to 14%.
- Your financial situation. The lender will look at traditional business loan requirements like your credit score, time in business and business income. If you appear to be a risky borrower, the rate you're offered will likely be higher.
- Your collateral. Lenders may offer you a better rate if you secure your loan with business collateral, such as inventory or property. This reduces the lender's risk because it can seize these assets for nonpayment.

- How to get the best business loan interest rate
- Improve your credit. You can improve your personal credit by identifying errors on your credit reports and disputing them with the appropriate credit bureau, making debt payments more frequently and paying down or paying off debt. In general, the higher your credit score, the better interest rates you’ll receive.
- Offer collateral. Securing a business loan with physical collateral, like equipment or real estate, can often help you access lower interest rates. Providing collateral (especially when it’s not required) can also help startups and borrowers with lower credit scores qualify for financing.
- Add a cosigner. If you’re a newer business — or have bad credit — adding a cosigner to your business loan may help you access affordable loan options. Your cosigner should have a strong credit and financial history.
- Provide a thorough business plan. Including a detailed business plan with your loan application can give the lender more confidence in your business, and therefore, help you qualify for the most competitive rates. Your business plan should show that you have a solid business model, a profitable market for your products or services and financial projections to prove your creditworthiness.

- What are current business loan interest rates?
- What is the interest rate on a business loan?
- Monthly or weekly interest rate. Interest is charged as a percentage on the outstanding principal each week or month. This does not include loan fees.
- Origination fee. An upfront fee charged for processing a new loan.
- Underwriting fee. Fees collected by underwriters who review and verify the documents you’ve provided, including financial statements, personal bank statements, credit reports and tax returns.
- Closing costs. Fees associated with servicing the loan such as a loan-packaging fee, a commercial real estate appraisal or a business valuation.
- SBA loan guarantee fee. SBA loans typically come with a guarantee fee of 0% to 3.75%, based on the size of the loan. Annual service fees may range from 0% to 0.55% depending on the size of the loan. The SBA evaluates and updates these fees every fiscal year[0]U.S. Small Business Administration.

- Factors that affect business loan interest rates

Financial Tips:
- Factor rate. Short-term lenders and merchant cash advance providers may charge a factor rate, which is multiplied by the amount of capital you receive to determine the total cost of your funding. Factor rates typically range from 1.1 to 1.5 — and often translate into high APRs.

Financial Tips:
- Do you feel as if you're just not making progress on your debt, no matter how hard you try? If that's the case, it could be time to consider debt relief.
- Debt relief options, such as negotiating directly with creditors, getting on a debt management plan or filing for bankruptcy can help eliminate your debt or make it easier to repay.
- What is debt relief?
- The term "debt relief" can mean many different things, but the main goal of any debt relief option is usually to change the terms or amount of your debt so you can get back on your feet faster.
- Debt relief could involve:
- Negotiating with creditors to settle the debt for less than the full amount owed.
- Negotiating with creditors to settle the debt for less than the full amount owed.
- Wiping the debt out altogether in bankruptcy.
- Wiping the debt out altogether in bankruptcy.
- Using a debt management plan to get changes in your interest rate or payment schedule.

- When should you seek debt relief?
- Consider DIY debt relief, bankruptcy or debt management when either of these is true:
- You have no hope of repaying unsecured debt (credit cards, medical bills, personal loans) within five years, even if you take extreme measures to cut spending.
- You have no hope of repaying unsecured debt (credit cards, medical bills, personal loans) within five years, even if you take extreme measures to cut spending.
- The total of your unpaid unsecured debt (excluding student loan debt) equals half or more of your gross income.

- What are the debt relief options to consider?
- Do-it-yourself debt relief
- You can skip an official debt-relief program and handle debt on your own through a combination of stricter budgeting, credit counseling, debt consolidation and appeals to creditors.
- For example, you can do what credit counselors do in debt management plans: Contact your creditors, explain why you fell behind and what concessions you need to catch up. Most credit card companies have hardship programs, and they may be willing to lower your interest rates and waive fees.
- You can also educate yourself on debt settlement and negotiate an agreement by contacting creditors.
- » Dive deeper: How to negotiate a debt settlement on your own
- If your debt isn’t too large, standard debt-payoff strategies may be available. For example, depending on your credit score, you may be able to get a 0% balance transfer credit card.
- That means moving your debt from a higher-interest credit card to a card with a 0% introductory annual percentage rate, or APR. The interest-free period means your whole payment goes to reducing the balance, making faster progress. Or you may find a debt consolidation loan with a lower interest rate than you're paying now.
- Those options won’t hurt your credit; as long as you make the payments by the end of the promotional period, your credit score should rebound. If you go this route, however, it’s important to have a plan to avoid adding more credit card debt.
- » Compare: Debt consolidation loans vs. balance transfer cards
- Debt management plans
- A debt management plan allows you to pay your unsecured debts — typically credit cards — in full, but often at a reduced interest rate or with fees waived. You make a single payment each month to a credit counseling agency, which distributes it among your creditors. Credit counselors and credit card companies have agreements in place to help debt management clients.
- Your credit card accounts will be closed and, in most cases, you’ll have to live without credit cards until you complete the plan.
- Debt management plans do not affect your credit scores, but closing accounts can hurt your scores. Once you’ve completed the plan, you can apply for credit again.
- Missing payments can knock you out of the plan, though. And it’s important to pick an agency accredited by the National Foundation for Credit Counseling or the Financial Counseling Association of America.
- As always, make sure you understand the fees and what alternatives you may have for dealing with debt.
- » Compare debt management plan companies
- Debt relief through bankruptcy
- There’s little point in entering a debt management plan if you’re not going to be able to pay as agreed. Talk with a bankruptcy attorney first. Initial consultations are often free, and if you don’t qualify, you can move on to other options.
- The most common form of bankruptcy, Chapter 7 liquidation, can erase most credit card debt, unsecured personal loans and medical debt. It can be done in three or four months if you qualify. What you should know:
- It will hurt your credit scores and stay on your credit report for up to 10 years. However, if your credit is already damaged, a bankruptcy may allow you to rebuild much sooner than if you keep struggling with repayment.
- It will hurt your credit scores and stay on your credit report for up to 10 years. However, if your credit is already damaged, a bankruptcy may allow you to rebuild much sooner than if you keep struggling with repayment.
- If you have used a co-signer, your bankruptcy filing will make that co-signer solely responsible for the debt.

- It may not be necessary if you don’t have any income or property a creditor can go after.
- It may not be necessary if you don’t have any income or property a creditor can go after.
- Not everyone with overwhelming debt qualifies for Chapter 7. If your income is above the median for your state and family size, or you have a home you want to save from foreclosure, you may need to file for Chapter 13 bankruptcy.
- Chapter 13 is a three- or five-year court-approved repayment plan, based on your income and debts. If you are able to stick with the plan for its full term, the remaining unsecured debt is discharged.
- If you are able to keep up with payments (a majority of people are not), you will get to keep your property. A Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for seven years from the filing date.
- Debt settlement: A risky option
- Debt settlement is a last resort for those who face overwhelming debt but cannot qualify for bankruptcy or don't want to file bankruptcy.
- Debt settlement companies typically ask you to stop making debt payments when you enroll in a settlement plan and instead put the money in an escrow account, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau says.
- Each creditor is approached as the money accumulates in your account and you fall further behind on payments. Fear of getting nothing at all may motivate the creditor to accept a smaller lump-sum offer and agree not to pursue you for the rest.

- Not paying your bills can result in collections calls, penalty fees and, potentially, legal action against you. Lawsuits can lead to wage garnishments and property liens. Debt settlement stops none of that while you're still negotiating, and it can take months for the settlement offers to begin.
- If your debt is settled, you may also face a bill for taxes on the forgiven amounts (which the IRS counts as income).
- The debt settlement business is riddled with bad actors, and the CFPB, the National Consumer Law Center and the Federal Trade Commission caution consumers about it in the strongest possible terms.
- Some debt settlement companies also advertise themselves as debt consolidation companies. They are not. Debt consolidation is something you can do on your own, and it will not damage your credit.

- Debt relief options to avoid
- Sometimes overwhelming debt comes with devastating swiftness — a health crisis, unemployment or a natural disaster. Or maybe it came a little at a time, and now creditors and collection agencies are pressing you to pay, and you just can’t.
- If you’re feeling overwhelmed by debt, here are some things to avoid if possible:
- Don’t neglect a secured debt (like a car payment) in order to pay an unsecured one (like a hospital bill or credit card). You could lose the collateral that secures that debt, in this case your car.

Financial Tips:
- If you have multiple student loans with different rates, the weighted average interest rate is the rate you'll have if you consolidate the loans through the federal government. Federal consolidation won't lower your average interest rate, but refinancing with a private lender could.

- » MORE: How to calculate student loan interest
- How to lower my interest rate on student loans
- Lowering your student loan interest rate can help decrease the total amount you pay over the life of a loan. Two options for lowering your interest rate are refinancing and automating payments.
- If you have good credit, you may be able to refinance existing student loans to get a lower rate. Keep in mind that you'll lose access to borrower protections like income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness programs if you refinance your federal loans with a private lender.
- Switching to autopay for federal student loans will save 0.25% on your interest rate. Many private lenders also offer a 0.25% discount for automating payment.

- How to pay interest on student loans
- Student loan interest accrues while you’re in school — unless you have subsidized federal loans — so you’ll owe more than you initially borrowed when you enter repayment. You can save on interest by:
- Pay off interest before your grace period ends. When your student loans enter repayment, the unpaid interest may be capitalized, or added to your principal balance. Avoid costly interest capitalization by making monthly interest-only payments or paying a fixed amount — say, $25 — while you’re in school. Alternatively, pay off the interest during your grace period using graduation money or income from your first post-college job.

- Watch your overall financial health. Although you’ll save the most in student loan interest by paying off the loan as soon as possible, other financial goals are higher priority. Before paying extra on student debt, build an emergency fund, contribute to a 401(k) or IRA, and pay off high-interest debt such as credit cards.

- What is a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage?
- A 15-year fixed-rate mortgage is a home loan that has the same interest rate and monthly principal-and-interest payment over the 15-year loan period. You can use a 15-year mortgage to buy a home or refinance an existing home loan.
- 15-year mortgages usually have lower interest rates than 30-year mortgages, but the monthly payments tend to be higher because you repay the money in half the time. However, since you can pay off a 15-year mortgage faster, you’ll pay less interest over the life of the loan. This feature makes 15-year loans popular for refinancing a 30-year purchase mortgage.

Financial Tips:
- You can find the best rate and save money by comparison shopping and applying with multiple lenders. Each lender offers its own combination of interest rate and fees.
- After you submit complete mortgage applications, each lender will provide you with a Loan Estimate form. This will let you compare interest rates, origination fees and closing costs and give you confidence that you’re getting the right loan for your situation.
- Mortgage rates vary daily and are influenced by the economy’s overall rate of growth, the inflation rate and the health of the job market. Unpredictable events can affect all of those factors. NerdWallet’s mortgage interest rates forecast gives a snapshot of current trends, along with a forecast for the month.
- Pros and cons of refinancing to a 15-year mortgage
- You will build home equity faster with a 15-year mortgage than with a 30-year mortgage, and you’ll pay less interest over the life of the loan. The higher monthly payments could squeeze your household budget, though. Here’s what to consider.

- Is it worth refinancing to a 15-year mortgage?
- With lower rates and major interest savings, it’s worth checking out 15-year refinance rates if you can afford a higher monthly mortgage payment. But if you want to pay off your mortgage faster, refinancing isn’t your only option. You can also make extra payments toward the principal each month. With this method, you always have the flexibility to back down to the minimum payment any time you need more cash flow.

Financial Tips:
- At face value, California's program for low-cost insurance seems like an easy way to get cheap car insurance. But after interviewing multiple insurance experts in California, I learned that almost every driver in this program is underinsured and at risk of being sued for an insurance claim. You should steer clear of this program if you have any other insurance options.
- NerdWallet found the companies offering the lowest car insurance rates for 35-year-old California drivers with different driving records. If you have multiple violations on your record, consider looking into the best high-risk car insurance companies.
- NerdWallet’s editorial team analyzed car insurance rates from 24 auto insurers in California and listed the five cheapest options for drivers in several age brackets and with different histories, all driving a 2022 Toyota Camry LE. For minimum coverage, we looked at rates that reflect the minimum requirements in California. For full coverage, we used the below coverage limits:
- Why you can trust NerdWalletOur writers and editors follow strict editorial guidelines to ensure fairness and accuracy in our writing and data analyses. You can trust the prices we show you because our data analysts take rigorous measures to eliminate outliers and inaccuracies in pricing data, which include rates from every locale in California where coverage is offered and data is available. When comparing rates for different coverage amounts, ages and backgrounds, we change only one variable at a time, so you can easily see how each factor affects pricing.

- Check out NerdWallet’s guide to state car insurance requirements for more details on how the required and optional parts of your California policy work.
- Getting cheap car insurance usually means getting the barest coverage required by law in your state. But state requirements can be quite low and leave you financially vulnerable if you’re in a serious accident.
- Low-income car insurance in California
- A household income that meets the program requirements.
- A household income that meets the program requirements.
- The federal poverty level depends on the year and the number of people in your household. For one person in 2023, the income limit for the program was $36,450.
- The program’s website has a calculator to determine income cutoffs for larger households, a rate calculator and a tool to find participating insurance plans. You’ll have to provide documentation of income, as well as other requirements, to qualify.
- For our “good driver” profile, NerdWallet averaged insurance estimates for single male and female drivers with good credit and no tickets or violations. The analysis included 5-10 of the largest insurance companies in each state; smaller insurers were also included when rates were available. Liberty Mutual and its subsidiaries were excluded from our analysis as rates were not available.
- We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit.
- We changed the credit tier from “good” to “poor” as reported to the insurer to see rates for drivers with poor credit.
- We looked at 35-year-old drivers to find the cheapest company overall, the cheapest company for minimum coverage and the cheapest company for drivers with poor credit in states where credit history is used to price rates. We looked at 20-year-old drivers to find the cheapest company for young drivers.

- Nerdy Tip
- LendingClub CD
- You can find higher APYs for multiple terms elsewhere.
- Alliant Credit Union Certificate
- The online credit union Alliant has a strong lineup of certificates, a robust selection of terms, IRA and jumbo options, and a fairly low minimum of $1,000. But the credit union doesn’t offer no-penalty or bump-up CDs. Membership is available nationwide by joining Alliant’s nonprofit partner at no cost to you.
- NASA Federal Credit Union Share Certificate
- NASA Federal Credit Union’s membership extends beyond NASA employees and includes anyone who agrees to a temporary, free membership to the National Space Society. NASA FCU’s share certificates have competitive rates and variety including bump-up options. Most terms require a relatively low minimum of $1,000, but some irregular terms have a steep minimum of $10,000, along with higher rates.
- NASA Federal Credit Union’s membership extends beyond NASA employees and includes anyone who agrees to a temporary and free one-year membership to the National Space Society. NASA FCU’s share certificates have competitive rates and variety, including bump-up options which allow for a rate increase if APYs go up. Penalties for withdrawing early are somewhat steep. Most terms require a relatively low minimum of $1,000, but some irregular terms have a high minimum of $10,000, along with higher rates.
- Andrews Federal Credit Union is a credit union that serves members of the military as well as anyone who joins the American Consumer Council, a nonprofit. The credit union’s fixed-rate share certificates have a wide range of terms and some variety, including certificates that allow a rate increase mid-term and ones for retirement. Certificates have a somewhat low minimum of $1,000 and generally high rates. There are retirement-focused certificates as well as several “raise-your-rate,” or bump-up, certificates which allow a rate increase mid-term if APYs go up. Penalties for early withdrawal aren’t too steep. Membership is available nationwide by joining a specific nonprofit at no cost to you.
- CFG Bank is a regional bank based in Baltimore, Maryland, that offers competitive CDs online nationwide. Unlike many banks, CFG’s CD lineup is limited in range, lacking CDs shorter than one year, but it makes up for it with competitive rates. The $500 minimum to open is low. Early withdrawal penalties are not disclosed without applying.
- Founded in 1935 in Illinois, the online-focused Alliant Credit Union is one of the largest credit unions in the country. Alliant has a strong lineup of certificates that includes a wide selection of term lengths, IRA and jumbo options, and a fairly low minimum of $1,000. Early withdrawal penalties include six months of dividends (equivalent to bank interest) for terms two years and longer, which is fairly low. Membership is available nationwide by joining Alliant’s nonprofit partner Alliant Credit Union Foundation at no cost to you.
- Service Credit Union focuses on members of the military but extends membership to consumers who agree to join a nonprofit of the credit union’s choosing. Share certificates come in a wide range of terms, though only some are competitive. The minimum deposit of $500 is low.
- You can find higher APYs for multiple terms elsewhere.
- However, it’s likely that 4% APYs will fall as the Federal Reserve continues cutting its benchmark rate as it did several times in the second half of 2024. The Fed’s overall strategy is to slowly lower its rate as inflation goes down. Banks and credit unions tend to follow the direction of the Fed rate in determining their CD rates.

- Choosing multiple CDs
- If the pressure of choosing one CD is too much, you might consider a strategy to balance cash access with high yields. Opening multiple CDs with different terms in a CD ladder lets you redeem CDs over time while taking advantage of competitive short- and long-term CD rates.
- The three main factors that impact CD earnings are the rate, the CD term and the CD deposit. Unlike regular savings accounts, you don’t generally have the ability to add money to a CD after the initial deposit. Here’s a look at some scenarios for how much $10,000 in a CD can earn in a year, compared to six months. (Or use our CD calculator.)
- Nerdy Tip
- If you had $10,000 to deposit, you'd earn around $220 with the 6-month CD and $400 with the lower-rate 1-year CD. When comparing CD rates, use a CD calculator to see how much you can earn with different term lengths.
- Promotional CDs refer to CDs with nontraditional term lengths, or less often, CDs with expiration dates on the rates being offered. While these CD rates may be higher than CDs with traditional terms, they may automatically renew into lower-rate CDs by default. See our list of promotional CD rates.

- Do you pay taxes on CD interest?Yes. Interest earned in CDs is taxable as interest income. Your bank or credit union will usually give you a Form 1099-INT that states the interest each year, unless the amount is under $10. The IRS notes that you generally include interest from CDs when you receive it, so a CD with a term longer than a year wouldn’t have its interest taxed until the term ends.

Application Process:
- It may also be helpful to create a budget that includes savings goals. One option is to follow the 50/30/20 budget, which means spending 50% of your after-tax income on needs, 30% on wants and 20% on savings and debt repayment beyond minimums.
- By consistently setting aside 20% of your income for savings, you may be able to generate an emergency fund, contribute to long-term retirement goals or begin paying off high-interest debt like credit cards.

Financial Tips:
- If you have multiple financial goals in mind, use this calculator to focus on each one individually. Then, you can decide whether it’s best to prioritize them or start tackling them all at once.

- Why should I compare 30-year refinance mortgage rates?
- Mortgage lenders vary in many ways, including what interest rate they'll offer you. Comparing refinance mortgage rates can help you find the lender who will give you the best deal.
- Borrowers who shop around can save significantly. Freddie Mac researchers have found that a home shopper who got two rate quotes could save up to $600 in interest per year, and a shopper comparing four or more rate quotes could save over $1,200 annually.

- Should I refinance to a new 30-year mortgage?
- Whether a new 30-year mortgage is a good idea depends on your unique financial situation and goals. The biggest benefit? Refinancing to a new 30-year loan can lower your monthly payments. However, that comes at a cost: Since you’re making payments for a longer amount of time, you’ll pay more in interest over the life of the loan — even if you get a lower interest rate when you refinance.
- If you do refinance to a 30-year loan, you can still make extra payments on the principal — for example, making higher payments every month, or switching to biweekly payments (to make the equivalent of an extra month’s payment every year). This way, you can pay off your mortgage faster while keeping some flexibility in your cash flow; when you need to, you can still choose to make the minimum payment.
- As an alternative to a 30-year mortgage refinance, you can select a shorter term length. Shorter terms have lower interest rates, and you’ll also pay less in interest over the life of the loan, but your monthly payments will usually be higher. You might also choose a custom term length — for example, 24 years — to match the number of years you had left on your original mortgage.

- How to refinance a mortgage, step by step
- Considering refinancing to a new 30-year fixed-rate loan? Here are the basics.
- 1. Figure out if a refi is the right move. Knowing your goal will help you determine whether a refinance will pay off. If saving money is your goal, you want to be sure that you're not only getting a lower interest rate, but also that you'll stay in the home long enough to reach the break-even point. If you have another plan, like taking cash out to renovate your home, make sure your budget can handle larger mortgage payments.
- » MORE: NerdWallet’s mortgage refinance calculator
- 2. Make sure your finances are solid. A track record of consistently paying your mortgage isn't enough. Make sure your credit score is in good condition and your debts are under control. If your credit score is on the low side or your debt-to-income ratio is high, you may want to work on those before applying to refinance.
- 3. Estimate closing costs. Just like a purchase loan, refinances do come with closing costs, which include a lender origination fee and appraisal. These generally run 2% to 6% of the amount of your refinance. Sometimes lenders will let you roll these costs into the amount you're refinancing — that's called a no-closing-cost refinance — but if you do that, you'll end up paying interest on a larger loan.
- 4. Compare mortgage refinance offers. You may want to get a quote from the lender that originated your mortgage, but you don't have to stick with the same lender. Comparing rate quotes as well as lender fees will help you get the best deal on your refi.
- 5. Choose a lender and lock your rate. Once you're applying for your refinance, you may also want to lock your interest rate. A rate lock holds your refi rate steady until closing. With a rate lock, even if mortgage rates go up while you wait for the lender to finish underwriting, your rate won't change.
- 6. Close on your refinance. There's less fanfare than with a home purchase — no one's handing over the keys — but otherwise, a refinance closing is pretty similar to a purchase closing. You'll pay the closing costs with a money transfer or cashier's check, and sign a raft of documents to start your new home loan.

Eligibility Criteria:
- If you’re in the market for a credit union, and you’d like to be able to visit a branch, check out the NCUA’s credit union locator. Just note that if you’re comfortable with banking online, you can choose one of the top five credit unions mentioned above that have wide eligibility, almost no matter where you live.
- How can I join a credit union?
- That depends on the credit union. Many credit unions were created by and for certain groups of people, such as employees of a certain company or residents of a certain town — and some are still fairly restrictive. If your job, location, faith community or other group is represented with a credit union, you can apply for membership usually at a branch or online.
- Other credit unions require only that you make a small donation (often less than $10) to an affiliated nonprofit to become eligible for membership. You can join these credit unions even if you live far from headquarters.

- Do the best credit unions pay more interest than banks?
- Credit unions have a reputation for paying more interest than banks, and it’s often well-deserved. According to the most recent data from the National Credit Union Administration, credit unions pay higher average rates on money markets and all surveyed certificate terms.
- But it's not hard to find an online bank that pays higher rates on savings and checking than the average credit union.
- If you’re comparing your credit union with big, brick-and-mortar banks, the credit union’s rates will probably come out on top. But if you’re comparing it with an online bank, the competition might be tougher.
- Do credit unions build credit?
- Individual credit scores come from a mixture of the following: the number of loans or credit card accounts you have, the number of on-time payments you’ve made, the percentage of your overall credit limit that you’re using, the number of hard credit checks that have recently been made for you, the derogatory marks (like bankruptcies or foreclosures) made against you and the age of your credit history.
- To this end, you can build your credit by taking out a mortgage, auto loan, student loan, personal loan or credit card with a credit union.
- Do credit unions check your credit?
- When it comes to getting a loan, a lender will typically pull a credit report on you, whether it’s a bank, a credit union, an online lender or another type of company. But for checking and savings accounts, policies vary. It’s more common for financial institutions to pull up your report through reporting companies such as ChexSystems, which records information such as past bounced checks and overdrafts, and Early Warning Services which collects information on banking activity and history.
- The only sure way to find out which reports your credit union pulls when deciding to approve you for membership or products is to ask.
- Do credit unions have ATMs?
- Yes, credit unions usually have their own ATMs and they often belong to a network of ATMs that customers can use to withdraw and deposit cash. These networks usually provide nationwide access to fee-free services at tens of thousands of ATMs.
- Are there any downsides to credit unions?
- Membership requirements. Credit unions have membership requirements and sometimes the requirements are too restrictive. However, there are cases where a potential customer can do something as easy as make a small donation to a partner charity to gain membership to a credit union.
- Limited branches. Many credit unions are limited to local, state or regional areas, which means in-person customer service can be hard to get, especially when traveling. To avoid this limitation, consider a credit union that participates in a shared branch and/or shared ATM network. The Co-op network, for example, offers access to more than 30,000 fee-free ATMs across the U.S., and more than 5,000 branches.
- Might not be as up to date on technology. Some credit unions may be behind the curve with their desktop and smartphone app designs, offering only bare-bone services. Make sure a credit union has the services you want (such as mobile check deposit) before you open an account.
- Services may be more limited. Smaller credit unions might not have the variety of services and products that larger banks do, so before you open an account, be sure your credit union has all of your preferred features.
- Credit union terms you need to know
- Credit unions and banks both have checking accounts and both pay interest on savings accounts, but they might call those products by different names. Here are a few credit union translations.
- Dividend: Another word for the return a credit union pays you to keep your money in an account, similar to interest paid by a bank.
- Shared branches: A shared branch network allows members of one credit union to visit branches of another credit union that are within the same network, such as the Co-op Shared Branch network.
- Share certificate: Credit unions typically use this term to refer to a savings product that is similar to a certificate of deposit at banks.
- Share draft account: Another term for a checking account. Some credit unions also call checks “share drafts.”

Financial Tips:

- If your federally chartered credit union fails, the National Credit Union Administration keeps your money safe up to $250,000 per person, per institution and per ownership category.
- High APYs and Easy Membership: Best Credit Unions
- Alliant Credit Union
- Andrews Federal Credit Union
- Connexus Credit Union
- NASA Federal Credit Union
- Service Credit Union
- Alliant Credit Union's High-Rate Checking earns 0.25% annual percentage yield if you receive e-statements and have at least one electronic deposit a month. There are no minimum balance requirements or monthly fees. And High-Rate Savings earns 3.10% APY on balances of $100 or more. There are no monthly fees if you opt for e-statements.
- Alliant members have access to more than 80,000 fee-free ATMs across the country. Anyone can apply to be a member. Among other ways of qualifying, people who live or work nearby its headquarters in Chicago are eligible to join, as well as those who agree to support the Alliant Credit Union Foundation and have Alliant make a $5 donation on their behalf.
- Andrews Federal Credit Union’s Kasasa Cash Checking account pays a super high 6.00% APY on balances up to $25,000. There are some hoops to jump through, however, to earn that impressive rate, including making at least 15 debit card purchases and having at least one qualifying electronic transaction monthly. Accounts that don’t qualify earn a lower rate for the month. There’s no minimum deposit requirement, no minimum balance requirement and there are no monthly fees for the account. The credit union’s high-yield savings account earns a competitive 4.00% and also has no monthly fee and no minimum balance requirement.
- Members have access to the Co-Op network of shared branches and ATMs, plus Kasasa Cash Checking accountholders get monthly refunds on up to $25 in domestic ATM withdrawal fees. Anyone can become a member; you can qualify by being an employee of a select employee group or by joining the credit union through the American Consumer Council.
- Connexus Credit Union’s Xtraordinary checking account earns 1.75% APY on balances up to $25,000 if you meet a couple of requirements, including subscribing to e-statements and making 15 debit card purchases or spending $400 with your debit card each month. It also reimburses up to $25 in non-network ATM fees each month. There’s no monthly fee. The regular savings account pays a much lower rate than the checking account, but the only requirement to earn interest is a minimum daily balance of $100.
- Connexus members can bank at about a dozen Connexus-branded branches, mostly in Wisconsin, thousands of shared branches and more than 67,000 free ATMs. Anyone can apply for an account after joining the Connexus Association, which provides college scholarships and financial education, for a one-time $5 fee.
- NASA Federal Credit Union’s share certificates (the equivalent of certificates of deposit at a bank) are competitive, with high rates for many term lengths. The minimum deposit to open an account is $1,000, which is similar to what other credit unions require. The credit union also offers add-on certificates which allow you to add money after the term has started, and bump-rate certificates which allow you to request a rate increase during the term.
- Anyone can join; NASA employees or people related to one are eligible, or you can become a member of the National Space Society compliments of the credit union, and that will entitle you to NASA Federal Credit Union member benefits.
- Service Credit Union offers the Everyday Checking account with three tiers of benefits. The basic level pays cash back on debit card purchases. The second tier (achieved by setting up direct deposit) offers the same plus early paychecks when paid by direct deposit, discounts on loan rates and up to $15 in monthly rebates for ATM and foreign transaction fees. The highest level (achieved by setting up direct deposit and making at least five payments or transactions each month) offers all of those benefits plus an additional $15 in monthly rebates for ATM and foreign transaction fees.
- There’s no monthly fee on the checking account, and no minimum deposit or balance requirements. Overdraft protection from a linked account is free. The credit union offers a huge network of fee-free ATMs that includes Allpoint and Co-Op networks.
- The Service Credit Union Primary Savings account pays a high APY of 4.00%, but only on balances up to $500.
- These credit unions represent some of the best institutions overall, but there may also be local winners in your community. Research if there’s a credit union or bank near you that offers low fees and gives you a good return on your money.
- What do credit unions do?
- Credit unions are not-for-profit financial institutions that, like banks, offer checking and savings accounts and long-term savings certificates. Some also offer loans and other products.
- » Ready to be a credit union member? Learn how to join a credit union
- Can I use both a credit union and a bank?
- Yes. There’s no rule that says you can’t keep some money at a credit union and some at a bank. It’s possible to use both services at the same time.
- What makes a credit union different from a bank? Are the best credit unions better than the best banks?
- Although they offer many of the same products, banks and credit unions operate differently. Credit unions are not-for-profit institutions, which often translates to fewer fees and higher savings rates. Banks, meanwhile, tend to offer a greater variety of products and better technology, but usually have more fees and lower savings rates.
- Many credit unions were also created to serve certain, specific groups of people, such as employees of specific companies. Some credit unions have expanded their membership requirements, but others are still fairly exclusive. It’s generally easier to join a bank.
- Keep in mind that many online banks have higher savings rates than the average credit union. And neither banks nor credit unions are necessarily better; you should compare both to decide which is right for you.
- Are online credit union accounts different from in-person credit unions?
- Online credit unions generally offer the same products and services as credit unions that have branches. You can typically deposit checks, pay bills, review your transactions and transfer money to your other accounts. If you live close to one of your credit union’s branches, you can get help there, too, but being able to transact online is especially handy if you’re not near one.
- Are the best credit unions also the biggest?
- Not necessarily. Some of the biggest credit unions have similar advantages to banks, including highly rated mobile apps and wide ranges of financial products. But you might get more personalized service at a small, local credit union. And some credit unions belong to the Co-op network, meaning you can bank at more than 5,000 credit union branches across the country and use more than 30,000 ATMs — that’s a larger ATM network than many banks have.
- Don’t count out your local credit union when searching for a financial institution.
- What separates the best credit unions from other credit unions?
- NerdWallet’s picks for best credit union typically pay high rates on your balances, charge few fees and have easily accessible customer service and relaxed membership requirements. Not all credit unions offer all that. Some have only a small number of branches and ATMs and limited customer service hours, or restrictive membership requirements, for example. That doesn’t necessarily matter; the best credit union for you is one that’s strong in areas that are important to you.
- » Need help deciding where to put your money? Learn how to choose a bank or credit union
- Is the money in credit union accounts safe?
- Yes. Like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which handles banks, the National Credit Union Administration insures customers’ deposits in case a credit union fails. All federally chartered credit unions must carry NCUA insurance. It covers credit union members’ deposit accounts: checking, savings, and money market accounts, as well as share certificates. The NCUA insures up to $250,000 per depositor, per institution, per ownership category. “Ownership category” refers to account types such as single (owned by one person) or joint (owned by two or more people).

Application Process:
- Keep track of your monthly cash flow — your income minus your expenditures. This step will also make it easier to mark progress toward your savings goal. Many budget apps can help you track spending.
- Another option is setting aside your spare change each night. After you have a sizable amount, you can deposit it into your savings and watch your account grow. In fact, when you want to watch your spending, it’s a good idea to use cash instead of credit cards because it can be harder to part with physical money. While this strategy won’t build savings overnight, it's a solid approach for slow-and-steady growth.
- By setting up automatic transfers from your checking account to your savings account each month (or via a company direct deposit), the money will accumulate over time with little effort. This technique can be especially useful when your savings accounts are dedicated to specific goals, such as establishing an emergency fund, paying off debt, going on a vacation or building a down payment.
- Tackle debt to save on interest
- 7. Pay off high-interest debt
- Debt payments can be a big burden on your overall budget. If you can pay off debt more quickly — by making extra payments or paying more toward the principal balance when you can — you’ll save on total interest paid and free yourself from that burden sooner. If you can't make extra payments right now, consider exploring ways to make money on the side that you can put toward your debt.
- 8. Lower your student loan payments
- If you have student loans, enrolling in income-driven repayment could lower your monthly payments to a manageable level since the amount you pay is tied to your earnings. Other options include refinancing student loans, enrolling in autopay to trigger a discount and making extra payments so you can unload the debt faster, which cuts the overall interest you’ll pay.
- 9. Refinance your mortgage
- If you own a home and are able to get a lower interest rate, refinancing your mortgage can save you several hundred dollars each month. But it’s important to consider other factors if you’re trying to decide when to refinance a mortgage. Use our mortgage refinance calculator to find out how much you could save. While refinancing comes with some initial costs upfront, they can be recouped over time, once you start paying less each month.
- Many cable and internet companies are willing to adjust pricing to keep you as a customer. Here's a script that can help guide your phone call to your provider.
- You might be paying for subscriptions you no longer use or need. Reviewing your credit card or bank statement carefully can help you flag any recurring expenses you can eliminate. Avoid signing up for free trials that require payment information, or at least make a note or set a calendar reminder to cancel before the free period ends.
- It’s also worth confirming a deal is actually a deal by tracking prices over time. You can use a shopping browser extension to automate the deal-tracking and couponing process. For example, the Camelizer extension from Camelcamelcamel makes it easy to view prices over time on Amazon, and the PayPal Honey extension will automatically find and apply coupons while you shop online.
- Making it more difficult to shop online may help you stop spending money on things you may not need. Instead of saving your billing information, opt to input your shipping address and credit card number each time you order. You’ll probably make fewer impulse purchases because of the extra work involved. You may even consider deleting any shopping apps from your phone.
- Refinancing your auto loan and taking advantage of lower interest rates could save you considerably over the life of your loan. Shopping around for car insurance regularly can also help you cut costs compared with simply letting your current policy auto-renew. You can cut ongoing car maintenance costs by driving less, removing heavy items from your trunk and avoiding unnecessary rapid acceleration.
- One of the easiest expenses to cut when you want to save more is restaurant meals, since eating out tends to be pricier than cooking at home. If you do still want to eat at restaurants, try to reduce the frequency and take advantage restaurant rewards your credit cards may offer.
- An emergency fund can be there for you when you face an unexpected cost or income loss. Building one starts with setting a savings goal and working toward it. The most important step is to start. You can set a goal to save $500 and work up from there. As mentioned above, you can use your company’s direct deposit feature to automatically move money into your savings each month.

Financial Tips:
- We grouped our money-saving tips into categories to make it easier for you to identify methods that will work for you. For example, you can zero in on your budget, tackle your debt, trim your monthly bills or try a combination of strategies.
- One smart way to manage your money — and hopefully hold on to more of it — is to follow a budget, which means comparing your income to your expenses and setting priorities for your spending. See our guide to how to budget, or try a free budget spreadsheet or even a piece of scrap paper to start.
- One method is the 50/30/20 budget for money management. This approach means devoting 50% of your after-tax income to necessities, 30% to wants and 20% to savings and any debt payments. If one of your allocations exceeds these percentages, you can make some adjustments elsewhere.
- Take control of your finances with the NerdWallet app
- Our app tracks your spending, credit score, net worth and more — so you have a clear view of your day-to-day and long-term finances.
- Set a specific and realistic goal, whether it's big or small. If you have extra income, that goal may be to save $2,000 in an individual retirement account this year. If you’re tackling debt, maybe you aim to pay an extra $50 toward your balance each month. Or, if money is tight, saving $5 per week can add up.
- Use a savings goal calculator to see how much you’d have to save each month or year to reach your goal.

Application Process:
- You can also reverse the process to find a comfortable housing budget by multiplying your income by your desired DTI ratio. In the above example, a $6,600 monthly gross income would allow a mortgage payment of $1,848 to achieve a 28% DTI. (6600 X 0.28 = 1,848)
- Sometimes loan officers will start right in with “Let's see how much you could borrow,” prepared to dazzle you with a high number. But the amount you could borrow doesn't necessarily translate to how much you can comfortably afford, since lenders focus on debt.
- Know what monthly payment could work for you before you start talking to lenders. This will help you keep things rooted in reality, especially if you know you've got hefty monthly expenses that aren't debts — think stuff like daycare.
- » MORE: Calculate your DTI ratio
- We've talked a lot about income, debt and down payment, but there are other factors you can consider when you're thinking about home affordability.
- Cash reserves. This is the amount of money you have available to make a down payment and cover closing costs. You can use your savings, investments or other sources. Some lenders may want you to have enough cash on hand to cover a few months' worth of mortgage payments, too.
- Cash reserves. This is the amount of money you have available to make a down payment and cover closing costs. You can use your savings, investments or other sources. Some lenders may want you to have enough cash on hand to cover a few months' worth of mortgage payments, too.
- Regular expenses. In addition to your debts, think about other monthly obligations or bills you might have. That could include expenses like childcare or groceries, as well as money goals you may have set for yourself, like putting a certain amount toward retirement each month.
- Regular expenses. In addition to your debts, think about other monthly obligations or bills you might have. That could include expenses like childcare or groceries, as well as money goals you may have set for yourself, like putting a certain amount toward retirement each month.
- Homeownership expenses. You'll have costs that go beyond your monthly mortgage payment as a homeowner. Some, like utilities, you'll probably incur no matter where you live (unless they're included in your rent). Those numbers could shift: Heating and cooling a house will likely cost more than an apartment. You may want to budget for emergency expenses and regular upkeep, too.

- Credit profile. Your credit score and the amount of debt you owe influence a lender’s view of you as a borrower. Those factors will help determine how much money you can borrow and the mortgage interest rate you’ll earn.

- Want a quick way to determine how much house you can afford on a $40,000 household income? $60,000? $100,000 or more? Use our mortgage income calculator to examine different scenarios.
- By inputting a home price, mortgage rate and the down payment you expect to make, you can see how much monthly or annual income you would need — and even how much a lender might qualify you to borrow.
- That calculator also answers the question from another angle: What salary do I need to buy a $300,000 house? Or a $400,000 house?
- How much house can I afford with an FHA loan?
- To calculate how much house you can afford, we’ve made the assumption that you're buying a home with a conventional loan. It's a fair assumption: In 2023, more than three-quarters of home loans were conventional loans.
- However, if you've experienced some financial setbacks or have a lower credit score, you might apply for an FHA loan.  Loans backed by the FHA can have more relaxed qualifying standards, though they do come with the added cost of required FHA mortgage insurance. If you want to explore what you could afford with an FHA loan, check out our FHA mortgage calculator for more details.
- How much house can I afford with a VA loan?
- With a military connection, you may qualify for a VA loan. Mortgages backed by the Department of Veterans Affairs typically don’t require a down payment.
- VA loans do have some limitations — for example, these loans can only be used to purchase primary residences. You'll also pay a funding fee in order to get the loan. To see what you could afford with a VA loan, use our VA loan calculator.
- Affordability and mortgage rates
- You will probably notice that any home affordability calculation includes an estimate of the mortgage interest rate you will be charged. Again, our default is to show you today's average interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate loan.
- When you apply for a mortgage, you'll be quoted a mortgage rate that is specific to your financial situation and mortgage needs. On any given day, mortgage lenders set their base mortgage rates depending on large-scale economic factors. Some change throughout the day, like bond markets. Others shift only periodically, like when the Federal Reserve takes action. And some, like the overall health of the economy, provide a constant backdrop.
- The interest rate you're quoted will be relative to a lender's base rate on the day that you apply. A higher credit score, steady income and a solid down payment should put you at the lower end of the lender's current rate offerings. Weaker financials and a lower credit score likely mean a lender will apply a larger margin to their base rate — lenders will want a higher interest rate for what they perceive as a riskier loan.
- A lower interest rate will help lower your monthly mortgage payment, so it's worthwhile to do what you can to find the best rate. Building your credit score, paying down debts and paying bills on time can help put you on solid financial footing. Comparing different mortgage lenders to see which will offer you the lowest combination of rates and fees can help you save, too.

Financial Tips:
- Example: If you earn $5,500 a month, your monthly housing expenses shouldn’t exceed $1,540. To find this number, multiply your pre-tax monthly income by 0.28. (5500 X 0.28 = 1540)
- Continuing the example, say you take on a home loan with that $1,540 mortgage payment and you've got another $500 in debt payments or other expenses. Your total monthly debts and expenses would now be $2,040. Dividing that number by monthly pre-tax income — again, $5,500 — gets you 0.37, or 37%.
- That's pushing a bit past the 28/36 rule's guidelines for total debts, though it may still be manageable. Monthly debt payments totaling $1,980 — just $60 less — would be in that 36% sweet spot. (5500 X 0.36 = 1980)
- How debt-to-income ratio impacts affordability
- Mortgage lenders tend to focus on your DTI as an important metric for calculating the amount of money you can borrow. DTI compares your total monthly debts (for example, your mortgage payments, including insurance and property tax payments) to your monthly pre-tax income.
- For example, if your monthly mortgage payment, with taxes and insurance, is $2,000 a month and you have a monthly household income of $6,600 before taxes, your DTI would be 30%. (2000 / 6600 = 0.30)
- Generally, housing expenses shouldn’t exceed 28% of your monthly income — there's that 28/26 rule again. Depending on your credit score and the type of mortgage you're getting, you may be qualified at a higher ratio.

- Is laddering short-term CDs a good idea?A CD ladder can be a helpful strategy if you don’t want to go all in on one CD, especially if you want to catch higher CD rates down the road. It works like this: you open multiple CDs at different terms, such as three months, six months, and one year, which frees up part of your funds more regularly than having, say, just a three-year CD. Each time a CD matures, you can either reinvest in a new CD or withdraw your money.

- Discover it® Secured Credit Card
- Like other secured credit cards for people building or rebuilding credit, the Discover it® Secured Credit Card requires a cash security deposit. Unlike most others, it offers rewards. But what really makes it stand out from the competition is its upgrade possibilities. The issuer has a process in place for automatically reviewing accounts for possible transition to an unsecured card. Read our review.
- The secured Self Visa® Credit Card
- Our pick for: No upfront deposit or hard credit check
- The secured Self Visa® Credit Card offers a unique path to building credit. Unlike typical secured cards, it doesn't require an upfront security deposit or a hard credit check.

It's complicated, but for those struggling to establish a credit history, it can be efficient and effective. Read our review.

You will owe a membership fee, however. Read our review.
- Why it’s wise to build credit as a student
- Building credit might not seem like an urgent priority when you're still in school, but the earlier you start the clock on your credit history, the better. Having good credit will be important down the road when you want to buy a home or get a car loan, but there are even more immediate benefits. For example, good credit can improve your chances of landing a job or renting an apartment.
- Your credit history, detailed in your credit report and summarized by credit scores, shows how well you've handled borrowed money — and using a credit card responsibly is one of the quickest and easiest ways to build credit. Among the situations in which good credit comes in handy:
- Borrowing money. Whether you’re applying for a credit card, car loan, personal loan, mortgage or other loan, good credit can be the difference between approval and rejection. Further, good credit can qualify you for lower interest rates, which saves you money.

- Who should apply for a student credit card
- Bad credit is usually a dealbreaker. Student credit cards are designed for people with little or no credit history. If you have bad credit because of missed payments or other missteps, you probably won’t qualify for a student card on your own. In that case, look to a card specifically designed for people with bad credit.

- How to compare student credit cards
- Student credit cards generally don't offer the same rewards and perks as “regular” credit cards. That's OK — the main purpose of student cards is to build credit with the goal of qualifying for better cards down the line. A good student credit card will save you money and report to all three credit bureaus (more on that below); rewards on top of that are just a bonus.
- » MORE: How to choose a student credit card
- The student credit card you choose should report to all three credit bureaus: TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. These companies gather the information used to calculate credit scores. That's why you want your good payment history recorded by all of them. All of our recommended student cards report to all three bureaus.
- It’s ideal to avoid an annual fee when you're on a student budget. In addition to keeping costs low, a no-annual-fee card makes it easier to keep an account open once you build enough credit to move on to better credit cards. Without an annual fee, you can keep your original credit card open to keep the length of your credit history and benefit your credit score.
- Cards designed for people new to credit tend to have higher interest rates, so it's best to pay your bill in full each month, which allows you to avoid paying interest entirely. However, some student cards give you an introductory 0% interest period, which can be helpful if you have a big purchase you'll need a few months to pay off.
- If you’re hoping to earn points or cash back for your spending, look for a card that offers a rewards rate of at least 1%. Some student credit cards are more generous, but 1% is a decent rate for a starter card. You’ll get more value if you choose a card whose rewards align with your spending. Some cards also offer a sign-up bonus. These incentives can potentially defray the cost of your college expenses, but only if you’re not overspending to earn them. If you do choose a student credit card with rewards, use it only for those purchases you already make within your budget.
- Foreign transaction fees are surcharges on purchases made outside the country, usually 1% to 3% of the total amount of a transaction. That can represent a serious hit to a student budget if you're spending a full semester in a study abroad program. If you plan to travel outside the U.S., look for a student credit card that doesn't charge foreign transaction fees. Some issuers, including Discover and Capital One, don't charge these fees on any of their cards.
- Another consideration when studying abroad is how easily you can use your credit card. Visa and Mastercard are widely accepted worldwide, but American Express and especially Discover are less so.
- » MORE: The study abroad student's guide to credit cards
- If you're having a hard time qualifying for a student credit card, consider a secured card. These cards require a security deposit, which is usually equal to your credit limit. Minimum deposit requirements tend to be $200 to $300, but some can be as high as $500. Pulling together the deposit can be an obstacle on a student income, so you may have to save up for it, or ask someone to help out. You get your deposit back when you close your account in good standing or upgrade to a “regular” credit card with the same issuer.  See our best secured credit cards.
- Making the most of your student credit card
- Once you've been approved for a credit card, you’re ready to get to work building credit. Here’s how to use your card to your advantage:
- Pay on time and in full every month to avoid interest. Use your card as a tool for building good credit, not for spending money you don't have. Use it for small purchases you can afford to pay back on time and in full every month to keep your card’s grace period in effect. You’ll maintain control of your budget and save money on interest.

- If you can’t pay your full balance, pay more than the minimum. In circumstances when it’s not possible to pay your full balance, at least pay more than the minimum amount due. You’ll make more progress toward eliminating your debt.
- If you can’t pay your full balance, pay more than the minimum. In circumstances when it’s not possible to pay your full balance, at least pay more than the minimum amount due. You’ll make more progress toward eliminating your debt.
- Use only a portion of your available credit. Your card might have a credit limit of, say, $1,000, but it's not wise to use the full $1,000. Keep your balance under 30% of your limit to maintain a good credit utilization ratio and protect your score. As a student, you probably won’t get a high credit limit anyway, so use your card primarily for smaller purchases.

- Be strategic with your sign-up bonus and rewards. If your student credit card offers a sign-up bonus, planning your application around upcoming expenses can help you meet the bonus requirements without additional spending. Choosing a credit card with rewards that match your spending will also prove more fruitful for your wallet.

- What to do with your student credit card after graduation
- Once you boost your credit score into the good-to-excellent range, you're more likely to be approved for regular, non-student credit cards with richer rewards and enhanced features. After you graduate and begin working (or move on to graduate school), consider your options with your student credit card:
- Upgrade it. Ask your issuer whether you can switch your account to a different card through a so-called product change. Doing so allows you to move to a card that better suits your needs while keeping the account open. That's beneficial to your credit score because it helps preserve the length of your credit history.

Doing so allows you to move to a card that better suits your needs while keeping the account open. That's beneficial to your credit score because it helps preserve the length of your credit history.
- Replace it. If you're paying an annual fee on a student card you don't plan to continue using, and the issuer won't upgrade you, you're probably better off applying for a better card and (once approved) closing the student card account.
- Replace it. If you're paying an annual fee on a student card you don't plan to continue using, and the issuer won't upgrade you, you're probably better off applying for a better card and (once approved) closing the student card account.
- Keep it — but in a drawer. If you can't (or choose not to) upgrade the card but you aren't paying an annual fee, it's smart to keep the account open even after you apply for other cards. Your credit score will benefit. Use a simple "autopay and everyday" strategy to keep your account active with one purchase — or several — throughout the year.

- In general, college student cards can be easier to qualify for than regular cards because they are specifically designed for people just starting out with credit. If you don’t have much of a credit history — if you’re a so-called “thin file” consumer — you’ll have trouble getting approved for many credit cards. The approval process for a student card, on the other hand, might de-emphasize credit history in favor of other criteria that suggest you’re a good credit risk, including your income and the fact that you’re in college studying toward a career.
- Often, college student cards offer features of special interest to people new to credit. These include incentives for responsible behavior, like a reward for always paying on time. They may also come with a free credit score and tools to help you learn to manage credit responsibly.
- Note, however, that while student cards might be more forgiving of an applicant with no credit history, they’re not for people with bad credit. If your credit score has taken a serious hit from mistakes you’ve made or from simple bad fortune, look to a card designed for “rebuilding” credit, such as a secured card, rather than a card for “establishing” credit, like a student card.
- Is it easy to get a student credit card?
- It’s harder than it used to be to get a credit card as a student, especially for those who don’t have significant income they can report on their application.
- There was a time when college students had very little trouble getting credit cards. Looking to build relationships with a desirable demographic — college-educated consumers with high earning potential — issuers flooded campuses with applications and would even offer incentives like a free pizza or T-shirt for opening an account. Students could get approved for a wallet full of cards even without income. Millions of students got started building credit this way, but many also ended up getting into trouble, running up debts they couldn’t repay.
- This kind of marketing ended with the Credit Card Act of 2009, a federal law that prohibited issuers from giving cards to people under 21 unless those people had independent income or a co-signer to guarantee their debt.
- How old do I have to be to get a student credit card?
- In general, you need to be at least 18 to get a credit card account in your own name. (People younger than that can be an authorized user on someone else’s account.) However, there are special rules that apply to credit card applicants under age 21.
- If you’re under 21 years old, you must be able to show on your application that you have independent income (such as from a job, allowance or scholarships and grants), or you must have someone else agree to co-sign your application. (A co-signer is someone who agrees to pay your bill if you don’t.) This is a requirement in federal law, designed to prevent issuers from giving credit cards to young people who have no means of paying for their charges.
- If you’re 21 or over, you still have to show that you have income, but you can include all income to which you have “reasonable expectation of access.” That includes your own income but also income from a spouse, partner or other member of your household.
- Do I need a job to get a student credit card?
- Having a job may improve your chances for being approved for a student credit card, but what’s most important is having income. If you’re under 21, you’ll need to show that you have independent income (such as from a job, allowance or scholarships and grants), or you’ll need to get a co-signer for your application. If you’re 21 or older, you can include any income that you have access to. Learn more about which income you can include on a credit card application.
- What should I do if I can't get a student credit card?
- Alternatives to getting a student credit card include:
- Becoming an authorized user. An authorized user is essentially piggybacking on someone else's credit card account (usually a parent's). You get a card with your name on it, but the primary cardholder is legally responsible for paying the bill. Authorized-user status can help you build credit if the issuer reports activity on the account in your name as well as in the name of the primary cardholder.

- Finding a co-signer. A co-signer on a credit card is someone who agrees to pay the debt on the card if the primary cardholder does not. Most major credit card issuers no longer allow co-signers, but smaller banks and credit unions often do. Having a co-signer can make it possible to qualify for a card you couldn't get on your own.

- Applying for a secured card. Secured cards are designed for people with bad credit or no credit. You put down a cash security deposit, and you get a card with a credit limit that's usually equal to your deposit. The card works like any other credit card — you charge purchases and then pay them off — but if you fail to pay your bill, the issuer can take your deposit to satisfy the debt. When you close or upgrade the account, you can get your deposit back. See NerdWallet's best secured cards.

- Using a prepaid debit card. If your primary concern is the convenience of paying with a card rather than cash or checks, a prepaid debit card can be a suitable alternative. With prepaid debit, you "load" money onto the card, and your purchases are paid for out of that money. However, because a prepaid debit card does not involve borrowing money, it won't build your credit like a credit card would. See NerdWallet's best prepaid debit cards.

Application Process:
- I’ve used 0% APR offers for large planned expenses to avoid tapping into my emergency fund and reap savings in the process. For instance, I previously used the 0% APR from a new credit card to cover a large vet bill. I earned rewards on the amount spent and I was also on my way to meeting the requirements for the $200 sign-up bonus. The interest-free window gave me enough time to pay down the bill, and my emergency fund was kept intact in case I needed it.

- HOW DO YOU USE 0% APR CREDIT CARDS?
- I moved into an older house that needed several updates: a new water heater, new curtains, new paint, new plumbing, updated electricity. I used a 0% card — the Citi Custom Cash® Card — to cover all these purchases and was able to pay off the balance within a year without interest. If I were paying cash, I might've spaced out those purchases more, but I wanted to get the work done before I moved in. (Living in a home while it's being painted seems … stressful.) The card helped me get the job done, and I earned a sign-up bonus and rewards in the process.
- HOW DO YOU USE 0% APR CREDIT CARDS?
- I seek out a 0% APR card that offers rewards and a sign-up bonus any time I have a big expense coming up. The 0% APR period allows me to make structured payments over time and preserve cash on hand, while the rewards and sign-up bonus help offset the overall cost. I used the Bank of America® Customized Cash Rewards credit card to finance a home remodel . I would have paid in cash, but the 0% APR period allowed me to put that cash in a high-yield savings account and earn interest over the promotional period.

- Reddit users who frequent the site's personal finance forums, particularly r/CreditCards, know that requests for credit card recommendations come up on a daily if not hourly basis. These requests are so common that r/CreditCards asks users to fill out a detailed template with enough information to help other redditors make an appropriate recommendation.
- Posters on r/CreditCards commonly ask "What's the best 0% card?" But those requests don't generate the volume of responses you typically see for questions related to rewards credit cards. That's because if all someone is looking for is a 0% intro APR period, there's not a lot to debate. The only real differentiators are the length of the zero-percent introductory period and, if the purpose is to pay down existing high-interest debt, the balance transfer fee. Beyond that, 0% cards pretty much all work the same.
- Searching r/CreditCards for "best 0% APR card" turns up dozens of discussions that come at the question from different angles, whether it's the best option for large purchases, for transferring, for business and so on. In that transfer discussion, one user boils down the options in 0% APR cards the same way NerdWallet usually does:
- The trick, of course, is making sure that you do, in fact, pay the balance in full each month. Not everyone is able to do so. But for those who can but sometimes choose not to in the interest of preserving cash for a "rainy day," carrying debt month to month is literally throwing money away. Several users offer helpful ways to frame the issue:
- "Treat a credit card bill like any utility bill. You wouldn't pay off 1% of your electricity bill every month, so don't do it with a credit card,"said a user who goes by Ranzar.

- What's the difference between a 0% credit card and a low-interest card?
- Both a 0% credit card and a low-interest credit card save you money on interest, but they do it in different ways — short-term versus long-term.
- A 0% credit card doesn’t charge any interest at all for a period of time after you open the account, then it shifts to an often-high ongoing interest rate. Zero-percent cards are good for people who want to spread out payments on a large purchase or gain breathing room to pay down debt without interest.

Zero-percent cards are good for people who want to spread out payments on a large purchase or gain breathing room to pay down debt without interest.
- A low-interest credit card charges an ongoing interest rate that's lower than other cards on the market. Low-interest cards are good for people who expect to roll over a balance most months (meaning they don’t pay off their balance in full every month).
- A low-interest credit card charges an ongoing interest rate that's lower than other cards on the market. Low-interest cards are good for people who expect to roll over a balance most months (meaning they don’t pay off their balance in full every month).
- How much will my credit card payments be with 0% APR?
- How much your card payments will be with a 0% APR depends entirely on which bank issued your card, how much you put on the card and how much you are able to pay. Every issuer has its own formula for calculating your minimum payment. It's usually made up of the interest and fees that have added up over the past month, plus a small amount of the actual debt, say 1% or 2%. There may also be a minimum dollar amount for each payment, such as $40 (except in cases where the total statement balance is less than that). When you have a 0% APR in effect, no interest is adding up, so your entire payment can go toward paying down your debt.
- How do 0% credit cards work?
- A 0% credit card works just like any other credit card except that for a certain period of time after you open your account, the bank doesn’t charge any interest on your balance. You’re still responsible for paying at least the minimum amount due each month. (And be sure you do: If you don't, the issuer might cancel your 0% period.) Once the introductory 0% period ends, your APR rises to the ongoing rate, and you will be charged interest on your balance going forward.
- What's the longest 0% period I can get on a credit card?
- Among credit cards from major issuers, the longest 0% APR periods tend to be around 18 months, although in a few cases you might find 20 or 21 months, especially for balance transfers. (Depending on the card, the 0% period may apply to purchases, balance transfers or both; some cards have different 0% periods for purchases and transfers.) Cards from smaller issuers or credit unions may offer longer 0% periods. It’s most common to see periods of 12 to 15 months.
- How can I qualify for a 0% credit card offer?
- Credit card issuers use 0% introductory offers to attract new customers, so to get one, your best bet is to apply for a new card that advertises a 0% period. Generally speaking, you’ll need good to excellent credit to qualify for a card with a 0% offer. That roughly translates to a credit score of 690 or better — although credit scores alone do not guarantee approval for any credit card. You’ll also need to be able to show income and meet other requirements.
- Should I close a 0% credit card after the 0% period ends?
- If the card doesn’t charge an annual fee, there’s no harm in keeping the account open once the introductory 0% rate expires. In fact, closing the account could hurt your credit score by reducing the amount of credit you have available, which could increase your credit utilization. If the card charges a fee, however, or if you fear that the open credit line will tempt you to overspend, then closing it might be the best action.
- Do no-interest cards hurt your credit score?
- A credit card with a 0% interest rate doesn't affect your score any more or less than a card with a regular interest rate. Your credit score takes into account how long the card has been open, how much debt you currently have on the card, the utilization ratio on the card (the current debt as a percentage of the total credit limit) and your payment history. The interest rate doesn't factor into scoring. That said, there are a couple of things to be aware of:
- Credit card issuers offer 0% promotions to entice you to use the card more. Overspending affects how much debt you carry on the card, and that can affect your credit scores indirectly.
- Credit card issuers offer 0% promotions to entice you to use the card more. Overspending affects how much debt you carry on the card, and that can affect your credit scores indirectly.
- Charge cards (as opposed to credit cards) do not let you carry debt from month to month. The full balance is due each month. Therefore, these cards charge no interest, so they could be thought of as "no interest" cards. Many charge cards don't have a preset spending limit. Without a specified credit limit, scoring formulas can't calculate utilization for the card, so these cards can have a smaller impact on your score than a regular credit card.

- How can I get a 0% APR on an existing credit card?
- Credit card issuers will sometimes offer you a promotional 0% APR on a card you already have — usually as an incentive to get you to use your card when you haven't been doing so. You can't really count on these offers, though. You could try calling your credit card company and asking for a 0% offer; it doesn't hurt to try. But this isn't likely to work if you've been using the card regularly.

Application Process:
- A lender’s loan offer will include the total amount you’re financing (called principal) and the amount you will pay in interest for borrowing the money. Earlier in a loan, a higher portion of your monthly payment will go to paying interest and less to principal. As you pay down the balance of the loan, you will pay less in interest. This process is called amortization.
- Auto loan calculators and car payment calculators automatically account for amortization, so these tools are the easiest way to figure a car payment. But whether you’re using a calculator or figuring by hand, the equation for a monthly car payment is the same.
- It’s total loan amount (including interest) divided by the loan term (number of months you have to repay the loan. For example, the total interest for a $30,000, 60-month loan at 7% would be $6,497.40. So the monthly payment would be $608.29 ($30,000 + $6,497.40 ÷ 60 = $552.50).
- NerdWallet recommends spending less than 10% of your take-home pay on your monthly car payment. When you have a target payment amount, you can use the auto loan calculator to figure what loan amount, term and rate will keep you within budget. Our car affordability calculator is another tool you can use.

Financial Tips:
- Tips for using an auto loan calculator
- An auto loan calculator is a powerful tool that can help you plan and possibly save thousands of dollars. Here are some ways you can use a calculator to reduce car-financing costs:
- To find the lowest-cost loan. Apply to several lenders for preapproved loan offers, but do it within a two-week timeframe to lessen any impact to your credit score. Using this auto loan calculator, enter interest rates and terms from the loan offers to narrow down your best option. If you’re buying a car from a dealership or online car retailer, you can use your own financing from a bank, credit union or other lender. If you’re buying from a dealership, take the lowest-rate loan offer with you, to see if the dealer can beat it.
- To find the lowest-cost loan. Apply to several lenders for preapproved loan offers, but do it within a two-week timeframe to lessen any impact to your credit score. Using this auto loan calculator, enter interest rates and terms from the loan offers to narrow down your best option.

If you’re buying from a dealership, take the lowest-rate loan offer with you, to see if the dealer can beat it.
- To decide on a loan term. Sometimes lenders and car dealers will reduce a monthly car payment by lengthening the loan term, which will increase what you pay overall. With this calculator, you can clearly see your total loan cost — not just the monthly payment — with various loan terms. You may decide a shorter term is the better choice.

With this calculator, you can clearly see your total loan cost — not just the monthly payment — with various loan terms. You may decide a shorter term is the better choice.
- To figure in additional expenses. Car buyers often don’t anticipate certain costs on top of a car’s price— such as state and local taxes, dealer documentation fee (which can vary widely) and registration fees. This calculator enables you to capture these costs under Add Advanced Info. To obtain estimates, you can search online, call your Department of Motor Vehicles or contact a dealership to ask for average costs in your area.

- An example of the difference a loan's term can make: If you take out a $40,000 new car loan with an 84-month term at 9% APR, you would pay about $623 monthly and $12,369 in total interest over seven years. Shortening the term to 60 months would increase the monthly payment to $811, but it would reduce your total interest paid to $8,600.

- Purchase loans are self-explanatory — enabling you to borrow money to buy a new or used car. Lenders usually define a new car as one that has never been titled and is the current or previous model year. Used cars are usually defined as being older than the previous model year.

Since leases are structured differently, you’ll want to use our car lease calculator to estimate monthly payments.

- Check your qualifications.     Consider factors such as your personal credit score, time in business and annual revenue. Bank and SBA lenders likely have the strictest eligibility criteria. Online lenders, on the other hand, may be more flexible.
- Estimate what payments you can afford.     Look carefully at your business’s financials — especially cash flow — and evaluate how much you can afford to apply toward loan repayments each month. Your total income should be at least 1.25 times your total expenses, including your new repayment amount.
- Determine whether and how you want to collateralize the loan.     Business loans can be secured or unsecured. A secured business loan requires collateral, such as property or equipment, that the lender can seize if you fail to repay the loan. Putting up collateral is risky, but it can increase the amount lenders let you borrow and get you a lower interest rate. Keep in mind, however, that although some lenders don’t require physical collateral, they may still take out a UCC filing on your business assets. This official document allows a lender to claim your assets in the case of default.
- Compare small-business lenders.     The best loan for your small business is typically the one that offers you the best terms. But other factors, like funding speed or customer service, may matter to your business and different financing sources may be better in certain instances than others.
- Apply for a business loan.     Of the loans you qualify for, choose the one with the lowest APR and best terms for you — as long as you’re able to handle the loan’s regular payments — and submit your business loan application.

Application Process:
- Debt settlement might suit people who don’t qualify for bankruptcy or who simply don’t want to file for it. The process involves negotiating with creditors to reduce the amount you owe. You can try settling debt on your own by contacting creditors or you can hire a company to do it for you.
- » Learn more about debt relief

Financial Tips:
- Debt consolidation involves using a special loan or credit card to combine multiple high-interest debts, such as credit card balances, into one monthly payment, ideally at a lower interest rate. Some potential benefits of consolidating your debt include:
- Shortening the time it takes to pay off your debt.
- Shortening the time it takes to pay off your debt.
- A balance transfer credit card or a debt consolidation loan are the main ways to consolidate, but note that you’ll likely need a good credit score to qualify or get a good rate. Each lender sets its own requirements, but generally scores of 690 or higher count as good credit scores.
- It’s also possible to borrow from your 401(k) or to use a home equity loan to pay debt, but you do risk your retirement savings and your home in those cases.
- If you feel like you don’t have enough money to pay down debt, getting clear on your budget may help you prioritize your spending.
- Finding ways to reduce your monthly bills can help free up more money to put toward debt payoff. And every little bit counts. Don’t be afraid to contact your service providers and see if you can negotiate a better rate on expenses like your cell phone bill.
- You may also be able to negotiate your bills for expenses such as your car insurance, credit cards, gym memberships and cable service. Switching providers might get you a better deal. Do your research to compare the rates of different companies.
- If you have the ability, making more money even in the short term can boost your debt repayment plan.
- Don’t rule out the possibility of increasing your current salary. Research and preparation may help you negotiate more money at your current job.
- Explore debt relief options
- If you’ve tried budgeting, negotiating your payments and bringing in more cash — all to no avail — you might want to try debt relief. Debt relief can help you change the amount or the terms of your debt to lighten your financial burden, but it’s not for everyone.
- You should consider debt relief if paying off your unsecured debt like credit card bills, personal loans and medical debt within five years isn’t feasible or if your total amount of unsecured debt equals 50% or more of your gross income. There are a few forms of debt relief:
- Debt management typically involves working with an accredited counseling agency to pay off your debt at reduced interest rates or with waived fees.
- Bankruptcy — Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 are the two most common forms — involves either erasing most unsecured debt or being placed on a court-approved repayment plan for three to five years.

- Refinance student loans: Your questions answered
- Should you refinance federal student loans?
- If you have federal student loans, keep in mind that refinancing to a private loan means you'll lose access to protections available only to federal student loan borrowers, like income-driven repayment plans and loan forgiveness. If you decide to refinance federal loans, you should have stable personal finances and emergency savings before taking that risk.
- Should you refinance private student loans?
- If you have private student loans, along with good credit and stable income, refinancing could be a good choice if you can secure a lower interest rate. Refinancing carries no fees or costs. For those who qualify for a lower interest rate, student loan refinancing may help you accomplish one or more of these goals:
- Pay less interest over the life of the loan.
- Pay less interest over the life of the loan.
- Pay off education debt faster.
- Pay off education debt faster.
- Reduce monthly student loan payments.
- Reduce monthly student loan payments.
- Refinance a parent loan in the child's name.
- Refinance a parent loan in the child's name.
- Use a student loan refinance calculator to estimate your savings.
- What happens when you refinance student loans?
- When you refinance student loans, a private lender pays off your existing loans and replaces them with one loan with a new interest rate and repayment schedule. Going forward, you’ll make monthly payments to the new lender.
- » MORE: How to refinance student loans in 7 steps
- What credit score do I need to refinance student loans?
- You — or your co-signer — typically need credit scores that are at least in the high 600s. Many refinance lenders seek borrowers with scores in the mid-700s. The better your (or your co-signer’s) credit, the better the rate you’ll likely qualify for. Additionally, you need enough income to comfortably cover your expenses, student loan payments and other debts.
- » MORE: Refinancing student loans with bad credit
- Is refinancing student loans better than consolidation?
- It depends on your situation and goals. If you meet the credit and income requirements to qualify for a lower rate, refinancing can save you money and help you become debt-free faster.
- If you consolidate your federal loans through the government, you won’t receive a lower interest rate, but you may qualify for loan forgiveness programs or income-driven repayment plans. Federal student loan consolidation won’t save you money. In fact, it may extend your loan repayment schedule, increasing the amount of interest you pay long term.

Some of the rates are based on the one-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) index and some are derived by adding a margin to the 30-day average SOFR index, published two business days preceding such calendar month, rounded up to the nearest one hundredth of one percent (0.01% or 0.0001).

- Fixed interest rates range from 4.99% APR (with auto debit discount) to 8.95% APR (without auto debit discount). Your interest rate will depend on your (and if applicable, your cosigner’s) credit qualifications. The fixed interest rate will remain the same for the life of the loan. Variable interest rates range from 5.99% APR (with auto debit discount) to 8.87% APR (without auto debit discount). Variable rates for Nelnet Bank Refinance Loans are calculated using either (a) the One-Month SOFR; (b) the 30-day Average SOFR; or (c) the forward-looking term rate based on SOFR as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and/or The Wall Street Journal “Money Rates” table on the twenty-fifth day (or the next business day) of the immediately preceding calendar month. The variable rate may reprice and change on the first day of each month if the SOFR index changes. This may result in higher monthly payments. The current One-Month SOFR index is 4.35% as of March 1, 2025. Lowest rates listed above include an interest rate reduction for eligible applications, enrollment in auto debit, and are available only to the most creditworthy applicants. Advertised variable rates reflect the starting range of rates and may increase over the life of the loan. The lowest rate for each loan type requires automatically withdrawn (i.e., auto debit) payments. The lowest rate is available only to the most creditworthy applicants. Not all borrowers will receive the lowest rate. The interest rate and Annual Percentage Rate (APR) may be higher depending upon (1) the credit history of the borrower and, if applicable, the cosigner, (2) the repayment option and loan term selected, (3) the loan type selected, and (4) the highest level of education attained. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate qualified for within the stated range. Interest rate reduction of .25% for automatically withdrawn payments from any designated bank account (“auto debit discount”). Auto debit discount applies when full payments (including both principal and interest) are automatically drafted from a bank account. The auto debit discount will continue to apply during periods of approved forbearance or deferment if the auto debit discount was in effect at the time of receiving the forbearance or deferment. Auto debit discount will remain on the account unless (1) the automatic deduction of payments is cancelled or (2) there are three consecutive automatic deductions returned for insufficient funds at any time during the term of the loan. Your actual savings, if any, may vary based on interest rates, balances, remaining repayment terms and other factors. Refinancing to a longer term may lower your monthly payments, but may also increase the total interest paid over the life of the loan. Refinancing to a shorter term may increase your monthly payments, but may lower the total interest paid over the life of the loan. Checking your rate results in a soft credit pull, which will not affect your credit score. If you continue with your application, Nelnet Bank will request your permission to obtain your full credit report from one or more consumer reporting agencies. This is a hard credit pull and may affect your credit score. Nelnet Bank offers various payment assistance programs to assist you if you are currently struggling to make payments.

- What are debt consolidation loans?
- Many people struggle with debt at one point or another. It may be the result of bad luck, like a job loss or unexpected medical bill, or the result of chronic overspending.
- But regardless of how you found your way into debt, rest assured you can find your way out. And one of the most effective tools for doing so is a debt consolidation loan.
- Debt consolidation loans are a particularly smart choice for consolidating high-interest debt, like credit cards, and are sometimes called credit card consolidation loans. They’re not an option for secured debt, like auto loans.
- You don’t need perfect credit to apply. Most lenders look at a combination of credit score, credit history, existing debt and income, and there are loan options for bad-credit borrowers (borrowers with a score of 629 or lower).
- Once you’re approved, you can use the debt consolidation loan to pay off all your debts at once, then pay back the new loan in fixed monthly installments until you’re officially debt-free.

- Credit card consolidation loan example
- According to our annual analysis, a household with revolving credit card debt owes over $10,000 on average. Let’s play out this scenario with a debt consolidation loan.
- If you have $10,000 in credit card debt, spread out across four different credit cards, you’re likely paying an average annual percentage rate of about 23%.
- If you’re making a minimum payment of $75 on each card, at 23% APR, it will take you four and a half years to be debt-free and cost an extra $6,200 in interest, on top of the original debt.
- But if you pay off all your credit cards at once using a $10,000 debt consolidation loan, at 15% APR, you’ll save $2,841 on interest – and you’ll get out of debt six months sooner.

- Expert take: How can I get rid of my credit card debt in 2025?
- "A new year always feels like a fresh start, so it’s a good time to get serious about your credit card debt. Consolidation is a solid payoff strategy, and though there are a few different ways to go about it, I’d recommend either a 0% balance transfer card or a debt consolidation loan.
- A balance transfer card lets you pay off your credit cards with no interest during the promotional period, but it’s a bit harder to qualify for since you need good credit. Debt consolidation loans are an option even if you have bad credit, and they have longer terms, which is super helpful if you have a lot of credit card debt to tackle.”

- When is credit card consolidation a good idea?
- A debt consolidation loan is a good idea when you can get a lower annual percentage rate than what you're currently paying on your credit cards or other debts. Like with all financial decisions, carefully weigh the pros and cons of consolidating your debts before you apply for a debt consolidation loan.
- By getting a credit card consolidation loan with a lower rate than your credit cards, you’ll save on interest, which makes the debt more manageable.
- Because you’re saving on interest, you can use that savings to make larger payments on your loan, speeding up your debt payoff timeline.
- Unlike juggling multiple credit card payments, you’ll have only one monthly payment with a consolidation loan.
- A credit card consolidation loan gives you an exact date you’ll be debt-free, which can help you stay motivated as you make the payments.
- Not all consolidation loans have low interest rates, and depending on the lender and your financial picture, you may not qualify for a rate that’s lower than your current debts.
- Your loan may come with an origination fee of 1% to 10% of the total loan amount. Lenders typically deduct this fee from your approved loan amount.
- Consolidating debt can be a smart choice, but it doesn’t eliminate debt. You still have to repay the loan, typically for two to seven years.
- If you’re in debt because you struggle to budget, a credit card consolidation loan won’t fix that. It may even make things worse if you use your newly freed cards to rack up additional debt.

- What's the average rate on a debt consolidation loan
- Borrower credit rating
- Score range
- Source: Average rates are based on aggregate, anonymized offer data from users who pre-qualified through NerdWallet from February 1, 2025, through February 28, 2025, and chose credit card consolidation or debt consolidation as their loan purpose. Rates are estimates only and not specific to any lender. The lowest credit scores — usually below 500 — are unlikely to qualify. Information in this table applies only to lenders with maximum APRs below 36%.
- On December 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate by a quarter point – its third and final cut of the year. There may be additional cuts in 2025, though none have been announced yet. Any reductions will likely lead to lower interest rates on debt consolidation loans, though it’s hard to say by how much, since debt consolidation loans are fixed-rate, meaning their rates aren’t as volatile as other types of credit like mortgage loans.
- Instead of trying to time your application perfectly, it’s best not to delay getting out of debt. That’s because lenders look at multiple factors when determining your rate, and the overall rate environment may have little effect on what rate you specifically get. Plus, continuing to carry high-interest debt like credit cards will only cost you in the long run.

Aim to pay off the balance in full before the zero-interest promotion expires and the APR resets to its normal, higher rate.

- Nonprofit organizations offer credit counseling, which includes helping you create a debt management plan. Similar to other consolidation products, these plans roll your debts into one manageable payment at a reduced interest rate.

- If you’re not sure how to tackle debt, you may not need to consolidate. The debt snowball and debt avalanche methods are two common and effective strategies for paying off debt.
- The snowball method focuses on paying off your smallest debt first, building momentum as you go. The avalanche focuses on paying off the debt with the highest interest rate first, then applying the savings elsewhere. Both can boost your payoff speed.
- If you have significant debt (40% or more of your income) and no plan to pay it off, you may want to explore other strategies, like debt settlement or bankruptcy. Both of these options help eliminate unsecured debts, but they hurt your credit and are typically a last resort.

Application Process:
- Our deep, independent analysis of IRAs sorts through key account details to find and evaluate the information investors want when choosing an IRA account. To see our full methodology and learn more about our process, read our criteria for evaluating brokers and for evaluating robo-advisors.
- More than 50 years of combined experience writing about finance and investing.
- Hands-on testing of the account funding process, broker websites and stock-trading platforms.
- Dozens of objective ratings rubrics, and strict guidelines to maintain editorial integrity.
- Good to know: If you're opening an IRA account for the first time, the process typically takes just 15 minutes and requires basic information, such as your name and bank account number. If you already have an IRA but you're searching for better options, switching IRAs is relatively easy: You can transfer your funds to a new provider, often without selling your investments. This is called transferring your IRA investments in-kind.
- when you open and fund a new investing account. Terms apply.
- It’s a simple process: You can open an IRA online, at any broker or robo-advisor (though we’re partial to the ones above, for the reasons we outlined). It takes about 15 minutes, and you’ll need to provide some personal information, including your name, birthdate, mailing address and Social Security number. Here’s our guide to opening an IRA, which also includes information about how to fund and invest the account.
- NerdWallet’s comprehensive review process evaluates and ranks the largest U.S. brokers and robo-advisors. Our aim is to provide an independent assessment of providers to help arm you with information to make sound, informed judgements on which ones will best meet your needs. We adhere to strict guidelines for editorial integrity.
- We collect data directly from providers through detailed questionnaires, and conduct first-hand testing and observation through provider demonstrations. The questionnaire answers, combined with demonstrations, interviews of personnel at the providers and our specialists’ hands-on research, fuel our proprietary assessment process that scores each provider’s performance across more than 20 factors. The final output produces star ratings from poor (one star) to excellent (five stars).
- For more details about the categories considered when rating providers and our processes, read our full broker ratings methodology and our full robo-advisor ratings methodology.
- Full list of IRA accounts considered for this list: Tradestation, Zacks Trade, Ally Invest, Charles Schwab, Interactive Brokers, Firstrade, Fidelity, Merrill Edge, Vanguard, Robinhood, SoFi Active Investing, JP Morgan Self-Directed Investing, Webull, Axos Self-Directed Trading, M1 Finance, Betterment, Wealthfront, Ally Invest Robo Portfolios, Axos Managed Portfolios, Schwab Intelligent Portfolios, E-Trade Core Portfolios, Fidelity Go, Acorns, Merrill Edge Guided Investing, Ellevest, SoFi Automated Investing, Stash, Vanguard Digital Advisor, Titan

Financial Tips:
- Multiple investment options.

- Terms and conditions apply. Roll over a minimum of $20K to receive the 1% match offer. Matches on contributions are made up to the annual limits.
- Offers several index funds with no expense ratios.
- Offers several index funds with no expense ratios.
- Note: Some of the IRA promotions above won’t apply for first-time depositors due to IRA contribution limits of $7,000 in 2024 and 2025 ($8,000 for those 50 or older). We’ve included promotions with low deposit requirements where available. You may be eligible for the IRA promotion if you're rolling over your existing IRA balance from another provider or account. If you're rolling over a 401(k), check to be sure the promotion will apply to you as rules can vary.
- Like Fidelity, Charles Schwab is one of the leading providers of retirement accounts, including workplace plans, such as 401(k)s, so it's no surprise that it stands out for IRAs. The company offers a variety of different types of IRA accounts, including self-employed plans such as SEP and SIMPLE IRAs. Schwab stands out for having helpful retirement planning tools — including educational content and calculators — and a large selection of mutual funds. It earns five stars in our analysis across three categories that we heavily consider in our methodology: number of no-transaction-fee mutual funds, number of low-expense-ratio funds and number of low-minimum funds. That makes it easy and inexpensive for retirement investors to start an IRA.
- We'll be honest and say our testers were surprised by how well Interactive Brokers scored when it comes to its IRA accounts — the broker is known for catering to active traders. But there are plenty of investors who want to trade in their IRA accounts — and there can be tax benefits for doing so — and Interactive Brokers deserves a spot on this list for its mutual fund offering alone. The broker has one of the largest mutual fund selections available, and our testers found the user experience of opening an account surprisingly smooth, even for novice investors.
- Like the active investing version of Fidelity, the robo-advisor is also an excellent choice. Fidelity Go offers free portfolio management on balances under $25,000. That's a great perk, especially because most robo-advisors tend not to favor investors with lower balances due to their fee structure. Fidelity Go also has no investment expense ratios (investment fund fees that portfolios at nearly every other robo-advisor will carry) and human oversight of your portfolio allocations.
- Picking the best IRA account will depend a bit on what matters most to you. Below, we detail some criteria to keep in mind:
- Low-cost investments: For long-term retirement savings success, make sure high fees don’t eat into your investment returns. Open your IRA at a broker or robo-advisor that offers low-cost investments. For many retirement investors, a smart investment is a low-cost mutual fund. Investing in a handful of mutual funds is an easy way to own a diversified portfolio, because each mutual fund invests in dozens, hundreds or even thousands of companies. With mutual funds, one of the main fees to focus on is the expense ratio. Ideally, you’re investing in mutual funds with an expense ratio of less than about 0.5%.
- Low fees: While you’re keeping an eye on expense ratios, also keep other fees in mind. If you’re a do-it-yourself investor who plans to open an IRA at a broker, make sure you pick a broker with no trading commissions (or a high number of commission-free ETFs and no-transaction-fee mutual funds) and low transfer and other fees.

Eligibility Criteria:
- Banks and credit unions typically offer the most competitive rates and terms on a business line of credit. To qualify, however, you’ll usually need to meet strict eligibility requirements, such as strong revenue, good credit and several years in business.
- Compared to online lenders, banks and credit unions can also be more likely to require physical collateral to secure your credit line (especially for larger limits), as well as more likely to charge additional fees, such as annual or inactivity fees.
- Some banks and credit unions also offer SBA CAPLines of credit. These SBA lines of credit are part of the 7(a) program, offering funding up to $5 million. There are four different credit line options based on your industry and financing needs.

Application Process:
- Once we uncover your personalized matches, our team will consult you on the process moving forward.
- How to qualify for a business line of credit
- Minimum Requirements
- Some online lenders will accept credit scores as low as 600, but traditional lenders will likely require strong credit. A higher credit score can help you qualify for the best rates and terms.
- Most traditional lenders will want to see at least two years in business. Online lenders are more likely to work with startups, provided they have a minimum of six months in operation.
- Businesses with lower revenue may still qualify for a line of credit. To get a bank business loan or SBA loan, however, you'll likely need annual revenue upward of $100,000.
- Pros and cons of business lines of credit
- Only pay interest on funds you draw, not the total credit limit.
- May be easier to qualify for than traditional term loans.
- Can be used to build business credit.
- Often have shorter repayment terms and lower funding amounts than traditional term loans.

- Where to get a business line of credit
- Banks and credit unions
- Although you’ll still need to meet strong qualifications to get an SBA line of credit, these products may be slightly easier to access than traditional bank credit lines. Like business bank loans, however, these SBA lines of credit require a detailed application process and will likely be slow to fund.
- Online lenders are a good option for startup business lines of credit or bad credit borrowers as they generally have more flexible business line of credit requirements compared with banks and credit unions.
- Online lenders typically have streamlined application processes and fewer fees, and may be able to issue small-business lines of credit in a matter of days. However, these lenders are also likely to charge higher interest rates than banks and may have lower credit limits.
- Secured vs. unsecured lines of credit
- Secured business line of credit
- A secured business line of credit requires you to put up assets such as inventory or property as collateral. If you fail to pay back the credit line, your lender could seize your assets.
- Because secured lines of credit help mitigate risk for the lender, these products often have more competitive rates and terms than unsecured options.
- Unsecured business line of credit
- An unsecured business line of credit doesn’t require physical collateral, but some lenders may still require a personal guarantee or a lien on your business’s assets.
- A personal guarantee gives a lender the right to go after your personal assets, like your house, if you default on a loan. A UCC lien is similar; a lender can seize your business assets if you haven’t repaid a loan.
- How to compare business lines of credit
- When trying to choose the best business line of credit for your needs, you’ll want to compare factors such as:
- Maximum funding amount. If you think you need a large credit limit, bank or SBA lenders may be a better option. Keep in mind that many banks also offer commercial lines of credit, which are designed to meet the needs of mid-size, high-revenue businesses.
- Maximum funding amount. If you think you need a large credit limit, bank or SBA lenders may be a better option. Keep in mind that many banks also offer commercial lines of credit, which are designed to meet the needs of mid-size, high-revenue businesses.
- Repayment schedule. Business lines of credit may require daily, weekly or monthly repayment. Consider your budget and cash flow to determine the type of repayment you can afford.

- Interest rates. Current business line of credit rates can range from 10% to 99% APR. In general, the stronger your credentials, the lower interest rates you’ll receive. Banks tend to offer more competitive business line of credit rates compared with online lenders. As you compare interest rates, consider whether a lender offers fixed or variable rates.

- Additional fees. Origination, draw and account maintenance fees can increase the overall cost of your business line of credit. You should make sure you understand any additional fees a lender charges and ask questions if the fees are unclear. You’ll also want to determine if the lender charges prepayment penalties for repaying early.

- Lender reputation. Reading online reviews or talking to other business owners can help you get a sense of what it may be like to work with a particular lender. Although there are many reputable online lenders, be wary of any company that offers “guaranteed approval” or makes similar promises that seem too good to be true.

To evaluate a company’s complaint history, NerdWallet calculated a similar index for each insurer, weighted by market shares of each subsidiary, over the three-year period. NerdWallet conducts its data analysis and reaches conclusions independently and without the endorsement of the NAIC.

Application Process:
- With no-medical-exam life insurance, the application process is streamlined. Depending on the policy you choose, you might have to answer some questions about your health and lifestyle, though some policies skip both the exam and questionnaire. These companies scored 4 stars or more:
- The next step is determining how much life insurance you need. Check out our comprehensive guide to learn different ways to crunch the numbers.
- A simple way to calculate your life insurance needs is to think about everything you pay for now and everything you expect to pay for in the future. This list could include everyday expenses like child care, utility bills and groceries, as well as long-term costs like college tuition and mortgage payments. Once you have a number, subtract the value of any assets you own. The final dollar figure is the gap a life insurance policy can help to fill.

Financial Tips:
- The cost of coverage varies among companies, so aim to compare life insurance quotes from multiple insurers.
- Buy online. We consider it a bonus when an insurer allows you to apply for and buy a policy completely online.
- NerdWallet’s life insurance ratings are based on consumer experience, complaint index scores from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for individual life insurance, and weighted averages of financial strength ratings, which indicate a company’s ability to pay future claims. Within the consumer experience category, we consider ease of communication and website transparency, which looks at the depth of policy details available online. To calculate each insurer’s rating, we adjusted the scores to a curved 5-point scale.
- These ratings are a guide, but we encourage you to shop around and compare several insurance quotes to find the best rate for you. NerdWallet does not receive compensation for any reviews. Read our editorial guidelines.

Permanent life insurance typically lasts your entire life.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/cash-out-refinance-rates

Eligibility Criteria:
- Compare cash-out refinance loan types. Considering the different types of cash-out refinance loan options can also help identify the best choice for your situation. While eligibility varies by program, the options include FHA, VA and conventional cash-out refinances.
- Cash-out refinance requirements
- As with any mortgage, you must meet certain financial criteria to qualify for a cash-out refinance. Here are a few of the general requirements:
- Credit score: Most cash-out refinances require a credit score of 620 or higher.
- Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio: Your DTI is a measure of your monthly debt payments against your income. Most lenders limit your DTI ratio to no more than 45 percent for a cash-out refinance.
- Equity: You’re required to keep a minimum of 20 percent equity in your home. (The big exception to this is if you’re doing a VA cash-out refinance.)
- Six months to a year of payments on your current mortgage: You typically have to wait at least six to 12 months to refinance your mortgage after the original loan closed, though there could be exceptions.
- How much cash can you get in a cash-out refinance?
- Many lenders allow you to tap up to 80 percent of your home’s current value in a cash-out refinance. Conventional and FHA cash-out refinances are limited to 80 percent of your home’s value, but with a VA cash-out refinance, you can get up to 100 percent. USDA loans don’t allow for cash-out refinancing.
- Cash-out refinance example
- Say your home is valued at $400,000 and you have $100,000 left to pay on your mortgage. If you wanted to get $30,000 for a renovation, you’d cash out $30,000 and add that to your $100,000 balance, for a new loan totaling $130,000. You’ll receive the cash shortly after closing.
- Should you do a cash-out refinance?
- You can use money from a cash-out refinance however you want to, but some of the most common uses include:
- Consolidating high-interest debt
- While there are valid reasons for a cash-out refinance, you should consider the pros and cons as well. They include:
- Pros of cash-out refinance
- Home value increase: If you use a cash-out refinance to renovate your home with a kitchen remodel or an addition, for instance, you could grow your home's value.
- Lower interest rates: Mortgages come with lower interest rates when compared to credit cards, personal loans and other forms of debt. You can use a cash-out refinance to pay off this higher-interest debt, which could save you money on interest and better your credit score by lowering your credit utilization.
- Cons of cash-out refinance
- Increased debt load: A cash-out refinance replaces your old mortgage with a new, larger mortgage. This means you’ll owe more, and could have a higher monthly payment.
- Closing costs: You’ll have to pay for some closing costs like you did for your original mortgage. For a cash-out refinance, the lender charges an appraisal fee, and might charge an origination fee, often a percentage of the amount you’re borrowing. With a cash-out, you’re getting a larger loan, so the origination fee reflects that.
- Foreclosure risk: Unlike credit cards and personal loans, mortgages are secured debt, with your home as collateral. If you’re unable to make your mortgage payments, your home will eventually be subject to foreclosure.
- Is a cash-out refinance a good idea? When’s the best time to do it?
- Vice President, Southeast Division, Nation One Mortgage Corporation
- A cash-out refinance can be a good idea if the cash is applied to something beneficial, such as a reduction in debt or renovations that may increase a home’s value.
- A cash-out refinance may not be a good idea if a very low mortgage rate was on the first loan being paid off with the new mortgage. Savings or benefits do not justify the increase over time, which could result in a scenario that is temporary relief but not as attractive years later when calculations are reviewed.
- If a home was purchased and has seen big equity gains that exceed normal conditions, the risk of a cash-out refinance combined with a loss in equity/valuation of the property could result in a tougher situation to sell the home at a later date.

- A cash-out refi can be a smart move when two things are the case: 1) home values are up, so you have plenty of equity to tap; and 2) mortgage rates are low. While home prices are high, so are mortgage rates. Therefore, a cash-out refi doesn’t make sense for most borrowers now. Homeowners who want to tap equity for renovations have been using home equity loans or home equity lines of credit instead.
- Cash-out refinance FAQ
- What is a cash-out refinance?
- A cash-out refinance is a type of mortgage refinance that turns a portion of your home’s equity into cash. You’ll swap your current mortgage for a bigger loan, pocketing the difference between the two in a lump sum. You can use these funds for any purpose, whether it’s for a home renovation, college tuition or other expenses.

- What are different types of cash-out refinance loans?
- If you qualify, you can do a cash-out refinance with a conventional loan, FHA loan or VA loan. A conventional cash-out refinance requires a credit score of at least 620 and a DTI ratio of 45 percent or less, and you can borrow up to 80 percent of your home’s value. An FHA cash-out refinance requires a credit score of 600 (though some lenders might require a higher score) and a DTI ratio of 43 percent or less, and you can borrow up to 80 percent of your home’s value. A VA cash-out refinance usually requires a credit score of 620, but that can vary by lender. You might be able to borrow up to 100 percent of your home’s value. You’ll also need to pay a funding fee.

- What is a limited cash-out refinance?
- A limited cash-out refinance is similar to a regular cash-out in that you’ll get a new mortgage with a new interest rate, and potentially a new term. The difference: You’ll only receive a small amount of cash proceeds. For a conventional limited cash-out, that amount is no more than 2 percent of the new mortgage balance or $2,000, whichever is less. This type of refinance might make sense for a borrower with a lower balance to refinance, or a minor expense to put the cash toward.

- How long does a cash-out refinance take?
- Generally, a cash-out refinance takes anywhere from 30 to 60 days to close. The timeline depends on many factors, including how soon your home is appraised and whether your lender needs to follow up in underwriting for outstanding information. You can receive your funds in as little as three days after closing.

Application Process:
- When you do a cash-out refinance, you’re getting a brand-new, larger loan with a new interest rate and terms. To find the best possible rate, comparison-shopping is crucial. Bankrate’s cash-out refinance rate table allows you to easily compare personalized rates from our marketplace of trusted lenders. Here is how to compare mortgage offers on Bankrate in three steps:
- Compare cash-out refinance offers: Bankrate can help you easily compare cash-out refinance offers with our rate table below, which allows you to filter options. As you weigh offers, consider the APR as well as the interest rate.
- Prepare for the loan application: In order for lenders to give you the most accurate cash-out refinance quote, you’ll need to get preapproved. This involves providing documentation about your current mortgage, income, assets and debt.
- Bankrate has helped people make smarter financial decisions for 40+ years. Our mortgage rate tables allow users to easily compare offers from trusted lenders and get personalized quotes in under 2 minutes. While our priority is editorial integrity, these pages may contain references to products from our partners. Here is how we make money.
- Today’s cash-out refinance rates
- While rates are not nearly as high as they were at their peak in 2023, they have yet to reach the lows that characterized the market in the pre-pandemic years. Looking ahead, 2025 is expected to be very similar to 2024; rates are largely expected to remain around the 6 percent mark. For this reason, to get the most competitive rate possible on a cash-out refinance, it's best to shop around and obtain quotes from several lenders.
- How to get the best cash-out refinance rate
- Because you’re taking out a bigger loan with a cash-out refinance, it’s all the more important to find the best possible rate. Here’s how:
- Review your credit. You won’t get the best interest rate possible if your credit score needs work. Well ahead of applying for a cash-out refinance, check your credit reports and scores. Many lenders allow you to qualify with a score as low as 620, but the best rates go to borrowers with a score of 740 or higher. Here’s more on how to improve your credit for a mortgage, plus bad-credit refinance options.
- Take stock of what you already owe. If you have other debt like a car loan or student loans, these factor into your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. The lower your DTI ratio — ideally 45 percent or less — the better your chance of getting a lower rate. Keep in mind: You’d be getting a bigger mortgage with a cash-out refinance, so it might be harder to maintain a lower DTI. To find out yours, use our DTI calculator.

Eligibility Criteria:
- Eligibility. Lenders may set eligibility criteria for qualifying, including restrictions on whether you can add a cosigner or co-borrower. Some lenders only do business in certain states. Others only offer personal loans for specific purposes, like consolidating debt.
- Additional features. Consider other features that might make your borrowing experience smoother. These can include easy online applications, prequalification tools, a range of customer service hours, discounts and unemployment protection.
- When choosing any type of personal loan, make sure you’ve reviewed both the APR and the interest rate. Knowing the APR may keep you from paying exorbitant fees on a personal loan, so you get as much of the money you borrow as possible.
- Good credit, a low DTI ratio and a stable source of income can all help you secure a low APR. If you have less-than-perfect credit, consider applying with a co-borrower or cosigner. If you don’t have a co-signer or joint applicant, compare bad credit loan rates before you apply to get the best deal available.

- Average credit score for personal loans
- When and how to refinance a personal loan
- What is APR on a credit card?

Financial Tips:
- Multiply your rate by the principal amount you’re borrowing
- Multiply this number by the term (in years)
- Add the loan fees
- Divide this number by the loan amount
- Divide this number by the number of days in your loan term
- Multiply by 365
- Multiply by 100 to get your APR
- What is the difference between APR and interest rate on a personal loan?
- The primary difference between APR and interest rate is that APR considers all the costs of your loan, while your interest rate does not. When lenders offer you an interest rate, it only reflects the percentage they collect monthly on the amount you borrow.
- APR, on the other hand, is a combination of the interest rate plus costs. It’s meant to show consumers and regulators how much the loan costs, including any fees.
- APR is also a tool to gauge whether you’re really getting the best deal on a personal loan. If the rate you’re offered is significantly lower than the APR, you’ll pay more in upfront fees. Personal loan fees can be over 10 percent and are deducted from your loan funds.
- Understanding the differences between APR and interest can help you compare both the total costs and the interest rate on personal loan offers. This can help to make sure you get the best bang for your personal loan buck.
- If a lender doesn’t charge any additional fees, the APR will be the same as the interest rate. No-fee loans are less common — you’re more likely to qualify for them with an excellent credit score.
- Some lenders may use APR and interest rate interchangeably. This may be a red flag that you’re dealing with a predatory lender. Federal lending laws require lenders to clearly close APR and interest rates on disclosures. Watch for last-minute changes to your APR before you sign: it could be a sign of last-minute fees being added to your loan.
- What is the average APR on a personal loan?
- According to a Bankrate study, the average APR for a personal loan is 12.37 percent as of March 12, 2025. APRs for personal loans can range from around 7 percent to 36 percent.
- Now that the Federal Reserve has begun cutting rates, keep an eye on changes to advertised rates online. You’ll likely need excellent credit to get the lowest rates. Check the APRs to make sure those low rates don’t come with high fees.
- What is a good APR on a personal loan?
- A good personal loan APR is typically below the national average. But to qualify for it, you’ll likely need a credit score above 670 and a stable source of income — or a creditworthy co-signer that meets these requirements.
- Securing a low APR can save you thousands of dollars over the life of a loan. For example, if you borrow $10,000 for five years, you will pay over $3,000 less with an APR of 8 percent versus an APR of 18 percent.
- How to compare personal loan rates
- The APR can help you get a sense of what your loan will cost, but it’s just one of many factors to consider when you’re shopping for a personal loan.
- Loan term. Your APR will likely be based on term length. Lower rates are generally offered for shorter terms. Remember: The shorter your term, the higher your monthly payment will be.

Application Process:
- A larger chunk of monthly payments go toward the loan principal rather than interest. With a 30-year mortgage, only a fraction of early payments go to repaying principal. A 15-year loan speeds up that process.
- Cons of a 15-year mortgage
- You’ll have higher monthly payments compared to longer-term loans. If you’re struggling to qualify, a 15-year mortgage will only increase the challenge.
- There’s a potential loss of mortgage interest tax breaks due to paying less interest. Many Americans no longer benefit from the mortgage interest deduction, but if you do, consider the tax implications.
- If I can afford it, should I get a 15-year mortgage?
- Vice President, Southeast Division, Nation One Mortgage Corporation
- I strongly recommend a 15-year fixed mortgage if the payment is affordable, as the significant amount of equity gained per payment is very substantial. Even with higher rates, the mortgage is much shorter, with much less interest, and it’s a great way to tackle equity with every payment made.
- Principal Writer, Home Lending
- I can answer that question only by asking one of my own: How do you feel about debt? If you view debt as a burden and you’re counting down the years to your mortgage-burning party, then absolutely opt for the 15-year loan over a 30-year mortgage. You might even consider a 10-year loan. With either of the shorter-term options, you’ll get a lower rate and you’ll pay far less in interest over the life of the mortgage.
- On the other hand, if you view mortgage debt as a tool and as part of your overall portfolio, then maybe the 30-year loan makes more sense. The rationale goes like this: You can use the long-term loan to leverage your home for investments. By extending your payoff date and lowering your monthly payment, you’ll have more cash to direct to retirement accounts and other investments.
- Either answer can be right — but the first step is to identify which debt camp you fall in.
- Refinancing into a 15-year mortgage
- If you have a 30-year mortgage and are more than halfway through your loan term, refinancing into a 15-year loan with a lower rate could save you thousands in interest. Bankrate’s 15-year vs. 30-year calculator can help you make the decision. Keep in mind that rates have shifted dramatically over the past few years. If you bought your home in 2020 and scored a rate below 4 percent or even 3 percent, today’s rates are going to look a lot more daunting.In general, 15-year mortgages have higher monthly payments due to the shorter term — but, depending on how much lower you can cut your rate and the balance of your current loan, your monthly payment might not increase as much as you think it will, or at all.Whichever type of refinance you pursue, shop around for rates and compare offers, including lender fees.
- 15-year mortgage FAQ
- What factors are considered in 15-year mortgage rates?
- Mortgage lenders set 15-year interest rates based on a number of factors, including your individual credit profile, income, debt and savings — the same factors that impact rates for any type of mortgage you’re applying for. Generally, the stronger your credit and financials, the lower the rate you’ll get. Mortgage rates are also influenced by outside forces, including Federal Reserve decisions and inflation.

- What are the requirements for a 15-year mortgage?
- There can be more strict requirements for a 15-year versus a 30-year mortgage. For the former, your lender has to make sure you can afford the larger monthly payments, and usually that means having a higher income and a lower debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. You’ll need to meet the lender’s minimum credit score and down payment requirements, as well. These vary based on loan type.

- How does a 15-year mortgage impact my tax deductions?
- With a 15-year mortgage, you pay less interest, so you also have less opportunity to take advantage of the mortgage interest deduction.
- There’s a caveat: The mortgage interest deduction no longer is of much use to most homeowners, no matter the length of the loan. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which is in effect from 2018 to 2025, allows most homeowners to deduct all of their mortgage interest payments for the year on home loans up to $750,000, but that deduction won’t do much for you unless you have other deductions to push you above the standard deduction. For 2025, a married couple filing jointly gets a standard deduction of $30,000. At that level, even a large mortgage with a long term and a relatively higher rate might not generate enough interest to take the tax break.

- Does a 15-year mortgage have a lower interest rate?
- Compared to longer-term mortgages, 15-year mortgages come with a lower interest rate. This accounts for the lower level of risk the lender takes on extending a loan over 15 years instead of 20 or 30, among other factors.

Application Process:
- Check your credit scoreThe higher your credit score, the better your rates and the more likely you are to be approved. If you have a credit score in the mid-600s or below, work to pay off existing debt and make timely payments on your credit cards to improve your score.
- Gather your application materialsMany lenders will ask for your Social Security number or other identification, salary, employment information and estimated home value. Now is also a good time to collect details about your home's outstanding mortgage balance. After you apply, lenders should reach out within a few days, although some online lenders offer same-day approval.
- Complete the verification processOnce you've accepted a line of credit offer, you'll have to provide verification documents, which may include pay stubs, W-2s or tax returns. You may also have to get an appraisal on your home. At this time, lenders will perform a hard credit check, which will temporarily ding your credit score.

- Comparing HELOC and home equity loan interest rates
- To conduct the National Average survey, Bankrate obtains rate information from the 10 largest banks and thrifts in 10 large U.S. markets. The rates shown above are calculated using a loan or line amount of $30,000, with a FICO score of 700 and a combined loan-to-value ratio of 80 percent.
- Note: The above APRs are current as of Mar. 12, 2025. The exact APR you might qualify for depends on your credit score and other factors, such as whether you're an existing customer or enroll in auto-payments.
- The average rate on a home equity line of credit (HELOC) fell two basis points to 8.04 percent on Mar. 12, a two-year low, according to Bankrate’s nationwide survey of large lenders.
- Home equity credit lines have variable interest rates that change based on the prime rate, which is tied to changes in the Federal Reserve monetary policy. At its first meeting of 2025 in January, the central bank held steady on interest rates, given the ongoing signs of a strong economy. But the pause followed three rate reductions in late 2024. The Fed’s next policy meeting is scheduled for March 18-19.
- Still, HELOCs are more attractively priced compared to unsecured personal loans, which currently average 12.37 percent, and credit cards, which average 20.09 percent. “Regardless of rate fluctuations, a HELOC is always a wiser choice than high-interest credit card or personal loan debt,” says Michael Tannenbaum, CEO of Figure, a home equity lender.
- If you’re looking to finance a renovation and have equity to tap, a line of credit could be less expensive than a home improvement loan. It’d also save you from a cash-out refinance, which could mean giving up a low rate on your mortgage in exchange for a new one.
- “Some current owners who have financial resources to make improvements to their homes could very well become more committed to staying in their current residences, which then only further reinforces the lock-in effect,” says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate. “That could all change if mortgage rates were to fall substantially, but that doesn’t appear to be in the cards in the near term.”
- A line of credit isn’t the only way to leverage your home’s equity. Another option: home equity loans, or second mortgages, which come with fixed interest rates. These have also been declining: As of Mar. 12, the average rates for a 10-year, $30,000 loan and a 15-year, $30,000 loan were 8.52 percent and 8.45 percent, respectively, according to Bankrate’s survey.

- To determine this best HELOC rates list, we surveyed over 30 lenders offering home equity lines of credit. The top HELOC rates displayed here may be special introductory rates, and represent the lowest advertised APR (annual percentage rate) based on a borrower with a credit score of 700 or higher and a combined loan-to-value (CLTV) ratio of 80 percent obtaining a 30-year, $30,000 home equity line of credit.
- Note that the lenders listed here are based solely on their offering the lowest APR, and are not necessarily the best overall HELOC lenders Bankrate has scored. Learn more about Bankrate’s lender review methodology.
- What is a home equity line of credit, or HELOC?
- With a HELOC, you’re given a line of credit that’s available for a set time frame (known as the draw period), usually up to 10 years. While most HELOCs have an interest-only draw period, you can make both interest and principal payments to pay off the line of credit faster.
- When the line of credit’s draw period ends, you enter the repayment period, which can last up to 20 years. You’ll pay back the outstanding balance that you borrowed, as well as any interest owed. A lender may allow you to renew the credit line.
- In addition to calculating your home equity, lenders look at your credit history, credit score, income and other debts. Most lenders require a combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 85 percent or less, a credit score of 620 or higher and a debt-to-income (DTI) ratio below 43 percent to approve you for a home equity line of credit.
- HELOCs combine relatively low interest rates with the flexibility to borrow what you need when you need it. If you need money over an unpredictable period of time, a line of credit is ideal. However, there are always risks when you take out a loan, especially one that's secured by your home. Here are some of the pros and cons of a HELOC..

- A HELOC is not the right choice for every borrower. Depending on what you need the money for, one of these alternative options may be a better fit:
- HELOC vs. home equity loan
- While similar in some ways — they both allow homeowners to borrow against the equity in their homes — HELOCs and home equity loans have a few distinct differences. A HELOC functions like a credit card with a revolving line of credit and typically has variable interest rates. A home equity loan functions more like a second mortgage, providing funds upfront in a lump sum at a fixed rate of interest.
- HELOC vs. cash-out refinance
- A cash-out refinance replaces your current home mortgage with a larger home loan. The difference between the original mortgage and the new loan is disbursed to you in a lump sum. The main difference between a cash-out refinance and a HELOC is that a cash-out refinance requires you to replace your current mortgage, while a HELOC leaves your current mortgage intact; it adds an additional debt to your finances.
- HELOC vs. reverse mortgage
- With a reverse mortgage, you receive an advance on your home equity that you don't have to repay until you leave the home. However, these often come with many fees, and variable interest accrues continuously on the money you receive. These are also only available to older homeowners (62 or older for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, the most popular reverse mortgage product, or 55 and older for some proprietary reverse mortgages).
- HELOC vs. personal loan
- Personal loans may have higher interest rates than home equity loans, but they don't use your home as collateral. Like a home equity loan, they have fixed interest rates and disburse money in a lump sum.
- Before you start applying for a HELOC, here are some home equity resources to prepare you for the process:
- Discover what home equity means and how you can tap it to pay for home renovations or pay off debts, and how to get the best rates.
- Follow these steps to calculate how much equity you have in your home and how to tap into it via a home equity loan or line of credit (HELOC).

- Everything you need to know about HELOC and home equity loan requirements: credit scores, DTI ratios and more.

Financial Tips:
- Before you start shopping for a HELOC, make sure you meet lenders’ requirements. Then, take some time to improve your credit score. If you carry a big credit card balance, pay it down. If your auto loan note is almost done, you might pay it off a month or two early. You might also make a few additional mortgage payments to increase your home equity. Once everything is in order, shop around. To find the best HELOC rate, compare multiple lenders — a rule of thumb is to get quotes from at least three. Remember, the rate is important, but it’s not the only factor you should consider. Competing HELOC rates are likely to be close, so be sure to also scrutinize fees and terms to get a sense of the APR, and make sure you’re not comparing apples to oranges.

- Interest paid on a HELOC is tax deductible as long as it’s used to “buy, build or substantially improve the taxpayer’s home that secures the loan,” according to the IRS.

So if you had a $600,000 mortgage and a $300,000 HELOC for home improvements on a house worth $1.2 million, you could only deduct the interest on the first $750,000 of the $900,000 you borrowed.

Financial Tips:
- Review your annual salary: If you are using life insurance to replace your income for a loved one, you may want to multiply your annual income by the number of years you have until retirement. That way, if you pass away, your loved one will receive a death benefit equal to the amount of money you would have contributed to the household.
- Think about your debts: If your life insurance is to pay off a debt, you may only need enough coverage to equal the principal amount of that debt. You could also use your life insurance to leave a financial gift for your beneficiaries, in which case the amount is up to you.
- Your hobbies: Just like your job, having risky hobbies could mean you pay higher life insurance rates or that you’re denied coverage altogether. Many applications ask if you are a skydiver, for example, and your answer may preclude you from coverage with certain carriers.
- The amount of life insurance you need is unique to you and your circumstances, so there is no exact formula for calculating what you will need. One way to start an estimate is to multiply your salary by the number of years you have left until retirement. This does not take into account, however, any debts you might want to cover with your death benefit, nor does it consider any gifts to charities or one-time costs, such as college tuition for a child.

- It depends on your needs. If you’re only buying coverage to provide a loved one with financial protection if you pass away before a debt is paid, you may only need coverage for the length of that debt. For example, if you’re covering your contribution to a mortgage payment, a 15- or 30-year term life insurance policy could be a good option, depending on the length of your mortgage. If you know you want to leave a financial gift for your children no matter what, you might opt for permanent life insurance, which lasts until your death (assuming the premiums are paid) and has no term period.

For example, if you’re covering your contribution to a mortgage payment, a 15- or 30-year term life insurance policy could be a good option, depending on the length of your mortgage. If you know you want to leave a financial gift for your children no matter what, you might opt for permanent life insurance, which lasts until your death (assuming the premiums are paid) and has no term period.

- There is no single company that is always the cheapest for everyone. Your price of life insurance will depend on your coverage type, limits and personal rating factors. Although life insurance quotes do not vary as much as home or auto insurance, you may still want to compare a couple quotes for reference. Note that insurers are legally not allowed to offer life insurance discounts, so the only significant ways to get cheaper coverage are to reduce your coverage amount or improve your personal rating factors before you apply.

- Auto refinancing is when you use a new car loan, with a new rate and terms, to pay off your old car loan. You'll need your driver's license, Social Security number and proof of income and insurance, as well as details about your car. If approved, your lender will likely pay off your old loan, and you will begin making monthly payments with your new interest rate and terms.
- How credit score impacts auto loan refinance rates
- Auto loan refinance rates are similar to rates for used cars, both being slightly higher than rates for new cars. Because car loans are secured with the car you are purchasing, and used cars depreciate faster than new cars, lenders perceive them as riskier and use an increased rate to offset their risk.
- Your credit score is another factor that impacts your auto loan rate. A good or excellent credit score can save you money by securing a rate that is lower than the average auto loan rate.

- Pros and cons of refinancing an auto loan
- The choice to refinance your auto loan requires some consideration about the state of your finances and vehicle. Weigh the benefits and drawbacks of refinancing before moving forward with it.
- Likelihood of paying off auto loan sooner.
- Risk of becoming upside-down on loan.
- When should you refinance your car loan?
- Refinancing your car loan comes down to saving you money. If you are struggling to afford your vehicle payments or think you could receive more favorable terms, it’s a good idea to consider refinancing your current loan. Here are the main scenarios where refinancing is the right choice.
- Your credit has improved: Competitive rates are reserved for drivers with very good or excellent credit — scores of 780 and above. So, if your credit score has risen since you signed off on your initial loan agreement, refinancing could save you money on your monthly payments.
- You financed through a dealership: Dealer financing likely did not present you with the best available rates and terms. You might be able to get a better deal if you shop elsewhere and refinance your initial vehicle loan.
- You can’t afford your monthly payments: If you are struggling to make your monthly vehicle payments and are at risk of losing your vehicle, it is a good idea to refinance your loan. This way, you can extend your terms to lower your monthly costs. Keep in mind that you will have to pay more interest over the life of the loan.
- You have positive equity: If you have positive equity in your vehicle, or the value of your vehicle is worth more than you owe, the cash-out refinance process could present you with some extra money and improved loan terms.
- Interest rates dropped: Interest rates have lowered since the federal funds rate was cut for a third time in December. If you financed your car when rates were higher, refinancing can help you take advantage of lower average rates.

- Can I refinance without good credit?
- Nationally recognized finance expert
- While it’s possible to refinance an auto loan when you have bad credit, you need to proceed carefully. Compare lenders and review the terms, rates and fee structures to protect yourself from predatory lenders. Remember that a low credit score comes with a high interest rate. So before you agree to a loan, be sure you can afford the monthly payments.
- Auto loans expert
- The short answer here is yes, you can refinance your vehicle without good credit. That doesn’t mean it is always the best move for your finances or your vehicle loan. Think of it this way: the reason you refinance is to get a more affordable loan. One of the best ways to refinance to a better loan is if you have stronger credit than when you borrowed initially. So if you crunched the numbers and need a lower payment, then it can be worth it. Otherwise, hold off until you’ve had more time to boost your credit so you can save more on interest.
- When should you avoid refinancing your car loan?
- When you’re close to paying off your loan: Unless you desperately need to reduce your monthly payment, refinancing close to the end of your loan is a risk. Lenders usually have a minimum term requirement, which can make it difficult. And even if you do gain approval, you can be left overextending and paying more.
- When you owe more than the car is worth: The further along you are on the loan, the more likely you are to become upside down.
- When your car doesn’t meet lender requirements: Lenders have restrictions on your financial background and the age and mileage of your vehicle. If you do not meet these conditions, a refi might not be possible.
- When fees will outweigh your savings: Some lenders enforce prepayment penalties, which can trigger if you pay your loan earlier than agreed upon. Ensure that you will not be stuck with high fees if you decide to refinance your current loan.
- How to refinance an auto loan
- To successfully refinance your auto loan, first decide if refinancing is right for you based on your current loan's terms, your credit score and your car's value. Then, if you decide refinancing will be beneficial, compare lenders and potential offers against the terms of your current loan to ensure you're saving as much as possible.
- Review your current loan:
- Most lenders require a minimum of $3,000 to $5,000 in order to refinance. Check your payoff amount along with your terms before starting the process.

- Check your credit score:
- Check your credit score to see if it has improved since your original loan approval. The higher your credit score, the better your new rate will be. While you can still refinance with bad credit, you'll want to consider the risks first.

- FAQs about auto loan refinancing
- Does refinancing my car hurt my credit?
- Refinancing can temporarily lower your score. When you apply for a loan and a hard inquiry is submitted, your credit score will drop five points. That said, FICO counts multiple auto loan inquiries within a 14-day period as a single inquiry, which can help prevent your score from dropping drastically while rate shopping. VantageScore has a more generous 45-day window, but fewer lenders use this credit system.
- Following approval, a new loan account will lower the average age that your credit score holds which can lead to a lower score. But these two factors are a small part of what makes up your credit score and sticking with a monthly payment you cannot afford will likely lead to larger credit issues down the road.

- Should I refinance if I’m far along on my original loan's repayment?
- It is best to refinance your loan in the early stages of your loan. The interest gradually declines over the lifetime of your loan, so your potential to save money is much higher at the start of your loan. Be mindful that you likely won't be able to refinance within the first six months.

- Does refinancing start your auto loan over?
- Refinancing does start your auto loan over, but it is not a perfectly clean slate. You will sign off on new, more competitive rates in order to save money on your monthly payments. It will make paying off the loan easier, but it is not a reset. Your new loan balance will reflect what you owed at the time you refinanced, not your original one.
- The number of payments on the previous loan also don't carry over to the new one. While the amount is still paid off, you won't have the mark of those payments on the new loan.

- Do I need cash to refinance?
- Some lenders will expect drivers with poor credit to put money down to provide extra security for the loan. So having cash to refinance can help by lowering the price you’ll have to pay to finance the vehicle. Though a down payment is not always required, vehicle equity — the difference in the value of the vehicle and the amount you owe — is.

- Can you get money back when you refinance a car loan?
- Refinancing does not automatically mean you are handed a check with more cash, but you may be able to benefit from the equity you have in your car. With cash-out refinancing, you essentially finance for more than you owe so that you get that leftover money in the form of cash — along with an improved auto loan.

- When you’re self-employed, a freelancer or run a small business, it can be beneficial to keep your business’ funds in an account that’s separate from your personal bank account. In addition to providing a clearer financial picture, keeping your funds separate may reduce your personal liability if your business were to be sued. It could also make for a simpler tax filing process than if your personal and business funds were kept in the same account.

Application Process:
- What to know first: The best bad credit personal loans give borrowers with scores below 580 a chance to get fixed-rate financing with a set payoff date. According to a data study conducted by Bankrate, bad credit loans currently have an annual percentage rate (APR) of 28.50 percent to 32 percent. Unfortunately, a low credit score will keep you from getting the lowest APR and potentially limit your loan amount and repayment term.  Bankrate’s team of experts vetted the top bad credit lenders based on whether they offer competitive rates and terms for borrowers with bad or thin credit, have a simple application process and how quickly they fund loans, among other factors. That said, check your lender's bad credit requirements. Some will only accept borrowers with scores over 600 or have rates above 36 percent.

- OneMain Financial: Best fast funding bad credit loans
- OneMain Financial: Best fast funding bad credit loans
- Overview: OneMain Financial offers same-day funding to qualified borrowers — even as soon as one hour after closing. But double-digit minimum APRs make it one of the more expensive bad credit lenders.
- Borrowers with spotty credit who need funds for an emergency may have cash the same day they apply for a OneMain Financial loan. For same-day funding, you’ll have to opt to receive the money on a “bank-issued debit card.” Other methods may take longer — the typical Bankrate borrower waited several days for their funds. If you don’t qualify for an unsecured loan, OneMain also offers a secured personal loan option.

- Compare lenders to find the best bad credit loan for your financial goals. Bankrate has gathered information about some of the top lenders on the market to simplify this process, but as you do your own research, consider the following:
- Interest and fees: The APR on a loan is the cost of one year's interest plus all the fees associated with your loan. While not every lender charges an origination fee, many bad credit lenders do, and this will be reflected in your APR.
- Repayment term: Personal loans have a typical term between two and seven years. To limit your interest costs, choose the shortest possible term you can afford.
- Loan amount: Make sure your lender offers loan amounts large enough for your financial plans. Keep in mind that origination fees are removed from your loan amount at the time of disbursement. For example, if you need to borrow $5,000 and your origination fee is seven percent, you'll actually need to borrow $5,377.
- Other factors: You may also want to consider additional details, including the lender's funding timeline, whether it accepts a cosigner or co-borrower and its customer reviews.
- How the Federal Reserve impacts bad credit loan rates
- The Federal Reserve sets the rate at which banks lend to each other, which then affects your APR on a personal loan. In 2024, the Federal Reserve cut rates by a percentage point across three meetings, but chose to hold rates steady at its most recent January meeting.
- Even if rates are cut in the upcoming months, they will still be higher for borrowers with bad credit. Even still, a personal loan tends to have more competitive rates than credit cards. So if credit card debt is hurting your credit score, it may be worth considering a personal loan to consolidate debt while rates are on the decline.
- What is a bad credit personal loan?
- Many personal loan lenders require good to excellent credit, but a bad credit personal loan is meant for borrowers who have a credit score of 600 or lower. However, minimum credit requirements vary by lender, with some considering anything under 620 to be bad credit.
- A bad credit personal loan can be a useful tool for managing debt. About 48 percent of credit cardholders carry debt from month to month, according to Bankrate’s Credit Card Debt Survey. Debt consolidation loans are a popular payoff method for those who want one monthly payment, less overall interest and a set number of payments to debt payoff.
- Similarly, emergency loans for bad credit are useful for funding urgent bills, such as car repairs or medical procedures, without depleting your savings account. And while Bankrate’s Emergency Savings Report found that 25 percent of people would finance an unexpected $1,000 emergency expense with a credit card and pay it off over time, personal loans for emergencies have lower average rates without the risk of overspending.
- Average personal loan rates by credit score
- Bankrate’s Market Analysis team reports on industry rates with the weekly Bankrate Monitor survey. However, the average personal loan interest rate of 12.37 percent is based on a credit profile with a 700 FICO score. As a bad-credit borrower, your rates are likely to be above the national average, but it varies based on factors like your credit score and financial situation.
- Types of bad credit loans
- Personal loans aren't the only type of bad credit loans available. Each serves a different purpose and caters to a specific financial need.
- Your bank’s policy may allow it to approve you for a short-term loan or minimal overdraft agreement. Of course, this depends on your banking history and ability to keep your account open. For more information, contact your bank and ask about your options.
- Who it’s best for: Borrowers with good credit and a solid banking relationship.
- Bankrate expert take on payday loans:
- "Always check with your bank to see if they offer any bank agreements or small-dollar loan options, especially if a payday loan is your only other alternative. Many large banks, community banks and credit unions are certified Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that participate in the Small Dollar Program. The small loan amount limits are typically capped at $500, and approval is based on activity in your checking or savings account at much lower rates than payday loans."

- A cash advance is similar to a short-term loan your credit card issuer offers. The sum you receive is disbursed in cash and borrowed from your credit card's available balance. Cash advances tend to have a higher APR than ordinary credit card purchases.
- Who it’s best for: Credit card users who have little or no balance and can pay the balance off quickly.
- "Credit card cash advances can tank your credit scores. That’s because the advance amount is added to your credit utilization ratio, significantly impacting your credit score. Consider adding a few hundred dollars to your emergency savings to avoid getting into a cycle of tapping your credit card for extra cash."

- Debt consolidation loans
- Debt consolidation loans are installment loans that allow borrowers to take on a new loan that combines several high-interest debts into one. The fixed rates are typically lower than credit cards, and the single payment helps simplify paying your bills each month.
- While you can get a personal loan with bad credit, it pays to improve your credit score first in order to secure a lower interest rate. If you are facing an emergency or unexpected expense, however, these steps may help you find the best bad credit personal loan for your financial situation.
- Check your credit. Before applying, get familiar with your credit report and your overall financial health. Dispute any errors at least 30 days before applying for a loan. A stable income and a low debt-to-income ratio may help you qualify for better rates on a bad credit loan.
- Compare lenders. To find the right loan, compare rates between three or more lenders. Bankrate experts have reviewed a wide selection of lenders that all accept borrowers with scores of 600 or lower. Use a personal loan calculator to determine if a new debt payment will fit into your monthly budget.
- Get prequalified. Prequalifying through Bankrate involves answering some basic information about yourself, including your full name, address and income. The process is free and there is no impact to your credit. Based on your information, you may be matched with one or more offers that you can customize to meet your needs.
- Where to get a personal loan with bad credit
- Bad credit loans are offered by credit unions, community banks and online lenders. To make sure you're getting the most competitive offer, prequalify with at least three lenders before submitting a full application.
- Online lenders: You'll generally find the most access — but potentially the highest rates — for low or bad credit via online lenders. They may work with investors that are more willing than banks to take bigger risks on borrowers with low credit scores.
- Banks: If you’ve been a customer at your bank for several years, consider looking into its personal loan options. Some banks may participate in no-credit-check small loan programs, although the guidelines and requirements vary depending on where you live.
- Credit unions: Check the member benefits to see if your local credit union offers bad credit loans. Most credit unions don't disclose their credit criteria, but shopping around is well worth your time, particularly with federal credit unions. That's because they're mandated to cap personal loan interest rates at 18 percent. Many also offer payday alternative loans, so check with your local representative before you apply for a personal loan with high interest rates.
- How to spot bad credit loan scams
- Avoid potential scams while shopping lenders by being aware of these eight signs of a personal loan scam.
- The lender guarantees approval: If you come across a lender that doesn’t ask about your payment history before assuring you that you'll be approved, you might be dealing with a predatory lender.
- The lender charges upfront fees: Reputable lenders don’t ask for any money to approve you or give you funds. Most deduct fees from the amount funded and provide easy-to-understand written disclosures that give you all the details about the loan you’re taking out.
- The lender gives you unsolicited offers: Unsolicited loan offers via email, phone calls, and door-to-door solicitation are not legitimate advertising practices of trustworthy lenders.
- Alternatives to bad credit loans
- Bad credit loans carry a reputation for high interest rates that can lead to long-term financial damage. It may also be more difficult to qualify for them — nearly half (48%) of Americans who’ve applied for a loan or financial product over the past 12 months have been rejected on at least one application, according to the Bankrate’s 2025 Credit Denials Survey. Before committing to a loan you're not positive you can qualify for or manage, consider the alternatives.
- You may be able to avoid going into more debt by getting a payment plan with the retailer or service provider you're working with. Check buy now, pay later options as well. A conversation and some planning may be all you need to avoid a bad credit loan.

Financial Tips:
- Personal loans made through Upgrade feature Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) of 7.99%-35.99%. All personal loans have a 1.85% to 9.99% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds. Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existing debt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months. For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month term and a 17.59% APR (which includes a 13.94% yearly interest rate and a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 in your account and would have a required monthly payment of $341.48. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total $12,293.46. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and your loan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actual rate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term, and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and fees may increase the cost of your fixed rate loan. There is no fee or penalty for repaying a loan early. Personal loans issued by Upgrade's bank partners. Information on Upgrade's bank partners can be found at https://www.upgrade.com/bank-partners/.

- This lender is registered in states where it does business, has a Consumer Loan Company License and was vetted by the Bankrate Editorial team.
- Avant is one of few bad credit lenders with a minimum credit score below 580 — its minimum is 550. The lender also offers customer service seven days a week if you plan to do some weekend number crunching.
- Submit income pay stubs
- Up to 9.99% administration fee
- Administration fee is partially refundable if you repay your loan early

- *Loan amounts range from $2,000 to $35,000. APR ranges from 9.95% to 35.99%. Loan lengths range from 24 to 60 months. Administration fee up to 9.99%. If approved, the actual loan terms that a customer qualifies for may vary based on credit determination, state law, and other factors. Minimum loan amounts vary by state. Administration fee is deducted from the loan proceeds and paid to the Lender. Any administration fee of 5% or less of the initial loan amount is not refundable. Administration fee amount in excess of 5% of the initial loan amount is refundable on a prorated basis over the remaining term of the loan when and if the loan is paid in full prior to its original maturity date. A partial prepayment does not trigger a refund of any administration fee amount. Borrower recognizes that the Administration fee is deemed part of the loan principal and is subject to the accrual of interest.
- **Personal loan funds are generally deposited via ACH for delivery next business day if approved by 4:30 pm CT Monday-Friday.
- Example: A $5,700 loan with an administration fee of 9.99% and an amount financed of $5,130.57, repayable in 36 monthly installments, would have an APR of 29.95% and monthly payments of $217.66.

The term, amount, and APR of any loan we offer to you will depend on your credit score, income, debt payment obligations, loan amount, credit history and other factors. Your loan agreement will contain specific terms and conditions. About half of our customers get their money the next day. After successful verification, your money can be deposited in your bank account within 1-3 business days. The timing of available funds upon loan approval may vary depending upon your bank’s policies. Loan amounts range from $2,000– $50,000. Residents of Massachusetts have a minimum loan amount of $6,500; Ohio, $5,001; and Georgia, $3,001. For a second Best Egg loan, your total existing Best Egg loan balances cannot exceed $100,000. Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) range from 6.99%–35.99%. The APR is the cost of credit as a yearly rate and reflects both your interest rate and an origination fee of 0.99%–9.99% of your loan amount, which will be deducted from any loan proceeds you receive. The origination fee on a loan term 4-years or longer will be at least 4.99%. Your loan term will impact your APR, which may be higher than our lowest advertised rate. You need a minimum 700 FICO® score and a minimum individual annual income of $100,000 to qualify for our lowest APR. For example: a 5‐year $10,000 loan with 9.99% APR has 60 scheduled monthly payments of $201.81, and a 3‐year $5,000 loan with 6.99% APR has 36 scheduled monthly payments of $152.83.

What this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you.

- * Applications submitted on this website may be funded by one of several lenders, including: FinWise Bank, a Utah-chartered bank, Member FDIC; Coastal Community Bank, Member FDIC; and LendingPoint, a licensed lender in certain states. Loan approval is not guaranteed. Actual loan offers and loan amounts, terms, and annual percentage rates ("APR") may vary based upon LendingPoint's proprietary scoring and underwriting system's review of your credit, financial condition, other factors, and supporting documents or information you provide. Origination or other fees from 0% to 7% may apply depending upon your state of residence. Upon final underwriting approval to fund a loan, said funds are often sent via ACH the next non-holiday business day. Loans are offered from $2,000 to $36,500, at rates ranging from 7.99% to 35.99% APR, with terms from 24 to 72 months. Minimum loan amounts apply in Georgia, $3,500; Colorado, $3,001; and Hawaii, $1,500. For a well-qualified customer, a $10,000 loan for a period of 48 months with an APR of 24.34% and origination fee of 7% will have a payment of $327.89 per month. (Actual terms and rate depend on credit history, income, and other factors.) Customers may have the option to deduct the origination fee from the disbursed loan amount if desired. If the origination fee is added to the financed amount, interest is charged on the full principal amount. The total amount due is the total amount of the loan you will have paid after you have made all payments as scheduled.

- Calculate your bad credit loan payment
- Calculating your estimated monthly payment will help you compare bad credit loans and determine which best fits your budget. On average, lenders offer rates between 28.50 percent and 32 percent to borrowers with bad credit. If you haven't prequalified with a lender yet, use these rates as a starting point to get an idea of what your monthly payment might be.
- How to compare loans for bad credit
- Who it’s best for: A borrower who intends to pay off a pile of high-interest credit cards or wants to combine multiple monthly payments into one single bill.
- Bankrate expert take on debt consolidation loans:
- "If you’re ready to get off the credit card merry-go-round but don’t have the cash to pay your balances off, a debt consolidation loan is worth a look. The fixed payment schedule gives you a definite payoff date. A bonus: If you don’t re-use the paid-off cards, your credit score may jump significantly. Debt consolidation loans are best if you have a stable income — you won’t have a minimum payment option to fall back on like you do with credit cards."
- - Denny Ceizyk, Bankrate Senior Loans Writer
- Debt consolidation loans are installment loans that allow borrowers to take on a new loan that combines several high-interest debts into one. The fixed rates are typically lower than credit cards, and the single payment helps simplify paying your bills each month.

- Emergency loans
- Bad credit emergency loans are useful for funding urgent expenses, such as car repairs or medical procedures, without depleting your savings. Be careful when comparing lenders — as with all bad credit loans, emergency loans tend to have much higher interest rates when you are below the fair credit mark.
- Who it’s best for: A borrower who requires fast funding for an expected expense.
- Bankrate expert take on no-credit-check personal loans:
- "If your emergency savings account is running low or non-existent, an emergency loan can get you cash quickly — even the same day at some lenders. You can spread your payment out while you recover from an accident injury or wait on a car or home repair to be completed. Watch out for origination fees — they’ll be deducted from the amount you borrow, and can be as high as 10 percent of your loan amount at some lenders.  Be careful of emergency loan scams and remember: You should never, ever pay any money upfront for a loan."

- HELOCs or home equity loans
- Home equity loans disburse a lump sum of money upfront, which you pay back in fixed monthly installments. Home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) work like credit cards at first, allowing you to use, pay off and reuse the credit as needed. The lender bases the loan amounts on your home equity and uses your home as collateral. On average, homeowners have a tappable home equity of $203,000, according to CoreLogic. While this can be tempting to use if you have bad credit, the risks likely far outweigh the benefits when compared to an unsecured personal loan.
- Who it’s best for: Homeowners with excellent credit who don’t intend to sell their home in the near future.
- Bankrate expert take on HELOCs or home equity loans:
- "If you have bad credit and own a home, I’d advise against taking out a HELOC or home equity loan. The equity in your home could put a pile of cash in your pocket if you need to sell it in a financial emergency, giving you a cushion to cover expenses if you’re laid off or just need to downsize to save money. Plus, like a car title loan, you risk losing your home and your shelter if a lender forecloses because you can’t make the payments."

- No-credit-check personal loans
- These loans can be secured (backed by an asset) or unsecured (no asset required). As the name suggests, you don’t need a credit check to get approved. That said, they come with sky-high APRs and fees, and often need to be repaid within a few weeks. No-credit-check personal loans are also not legal in every state.

- Payday loans
- These are short-term loans, typically for $500 or less. They charge fees that can drive the APR up above 600 percent. They’re a popular choice for fast cash and repayment is typically due by your next paycheck.
- Bankrate expert take on payday loans:
- "Many payday lenders prey on people in desperate circumstances or on young people who don’t understand the repayment terms. A CFPB study found that half of all online payday borrowers default. What’s worse, some payday loan contracts give the lenders the legal right to garnish wages or pursue criminal action if they aren’t paid off. If you’re in one of the states that authorize high-cost payday lending, check the fine print."

- Car title loans
- You must own your vehicle outright to take out a car title loan. Typically you can borrow 25 to 50 percent of your vehicle's value. The turnaround on these loans is short — usually just between 15 and 30 days.
- Who it’s best for: Borrowers who fully own their car and don’t qualify for unsecured bad credit loans.
- Bankrate expert take on car title loans:
- "It's best to avoid loans secured by assets tied to basic needs. A car is necessary for transportation to buy groceries, take kids to school or get you to work. A title loan may give you quick cash, but it also puts you at risk of losing your transportation if you can’t repay it."

- "It's best to avoid loans secured by assets tied to basic needs. A car is necessary for transportation to buy groceries, take kids to school or get you to work. A title loan may give you quick cash, but it also puts you at risk of losing your transportation if you can’t repay it."
- - Denny Ceizyk, Bankrate Senior Loans Writer
- Car title loans
- You must own your vehicle outright to take out a car title loan. Typically you can borrow 25 to 50 percent of your vehicle's value. The turnaround on these loans is short — usually just between 15 and 30 days.

- Pros and cons of bad credit personal loans
- Personal loans for borrowers with bad credit can provide access to quick cash in an emergency. They can also provide relief from high-interest credit card debt. However, there are disadvantages to consider before making a decision. Fully weigh the pros and cons of bad credit loans before taking one out.
- Save hundreds of dollars in interest compared to credit cards.
- Pay off revolving debt like credit cards and boost your credit score.
- Qualify more easily than with home equity loans.
- Incur origination fees up to 12 percent of the loan amount.
- Receive funds all at once instead of reusing credit.
- May not qualify if you don’t have a steady income.
- Pay higher interest rates and costs than home equity loans.
- Receive shorter terms than home equity loans or cash-out refinances.
- Ask the experts: If I get a bad credit personal loan, can I refinance it later?
- Student Loans and Student Aid Expert, College Admissions and Financial Aid
- "You may be able to refinance a bad credit personal loan, depending on your specific circumstances. You might qualify for a new loan at a lower interest rate if your credit score has improved or prevailing interest rates have decreased. If your income has increased or you’ve paid down other debt, your debt-to-income ratio may have decreased, making you more attractive to potential lenders. Adding a cosigner with very good or excellent credit can help you qualify for a lower interest rate. Lender criteria may vary, so it pays to shop around."
- Senior writer, Loans
- "It may be worth it to refinance a bad credit personal loan if your scores have improved enough to get a much lower rate. First, determine if your lender charges a penalty for paying the loan off early. If they do, a refinance may not make financial sense because the prepayment penalty costs will eat into your refinance savings. Second, if the lender charges fees for your refinance, calculate your refinance breakeven point. For example, if a refinance will save you $50 per month but costs you $1,000, it will take you 20 months to recoup the refinance costs. Refinancing makes sense if you plan to keep the loan for more than 20 months. Finally, avoid extending your term if possible. An example of this would be if you have three years left on a five-year personal loan term, try to refinance to a new loan with a three-year term, so you don’t start the five-year payoff clock again."
- How to get a personal loan with bad credit
- Can you get multiple bad credit loans?
- Although you can take out multiple bad credit loans, it’s best to avoid doing so, as it can result in a cycle of debt that's difficult to break out of. If you find you’re relying on bad credit personal loans to consolidate debt, it may be time to seek financial counseling.

- Should I take out a bad credit personal loan?
- While you will face a higher average interest rate, a bad credit personal loan can be useful in some situations:
- If you need to consolidate multiple high-interest debts.
- However, a personal loan might not be right for you if you can wait and make a purchase with savings instead. Other options, like balance transfer credit cards or tapping your home equity, may be a better choice if you are confident in your ability to repay what you borrow. Since these offer lower rates than bad credit personal loans, you may be able to save money — although these products come with their own risks.

- Coverage.com, LLC is a licensed insurance producer (NPN: 19966249). Coverage.com services are only available in states where it is licensed. Coverage.com may not offer insurance coverage in all states or scenarios.

The information on this site does not modify any insurance policy terms in any way.
- Insurance is a highly individualized product, and every driver has different needs to meet in terms of both coverage and budget. Are you willing to spend a little more for top-notch customer service, or is price the primary determining factor? Does your vehicle need special coverage, or are you looking for a standard policy with improved perks like discounts and the latest digital tools? Setting a budget and outlining your priorities will simplify the shopping process.
- You will need to provide basic information (such as names and birthdays) for all the drivers in your household. While you probably won't need their driver's license numbers during the quoting process, you will need them to purchase the policy and may want to gather this information now to make it easier to purchase the policy later. Additionally, the company may run your credit-based insurance score if you live in a state that allows insurance companies to consider your credit history as part of calculating your car insurance rate.

- It's vital to give a detailed account of the accidents, tickets and suspensions you and any other drivers on your policy have received over the last three to 10 years. Because most companies don't run driving records until you decide to purchase the policy, failure to provide this information during the process could result in inaccurate quotes that change significantly when you finalize your policy.

Financial Tips:
- Once you have a solid credit score, review refinancing rates from different lenders. Some offer fixed and variable interest rates, giving you the flexibility to choose the one that works best for you. It’s important to compare multiple lenders to see which one offers you the best deal for your financial situation. Review interest rates, repayment terms, potential fees, discounts and hardship programs for borrowers. Many lenders offer prequalification, which asks for basic financial details in exchange for your estimated rate and terms — all without a hard credit check.

- There are high income households that blow through it all and can’t save a dime, and there are households with very modest incomes that are prodigious savers. The common traits I’ve seen among good savers from all walks of life is the desire and discipline to save, making it a priority, a willingness to sacrifice and delay gratification, and keeping expenses in check. If you can save when you’re young or when you have a modest income, the habit stays with you if you move up the income scale. However, I have yet to meet a spendthrift that was able to flip a switch once reaching a certain age or income level and transform into a strong saver. If you’re unable to save, what are the barriers keeping you from doing so and what can you do to find a way around them?

- Before applying for a private student loan, Citizens and Monogram recommend exhausting all financial aid alternatives including grants, scholarships, and federal student loans.

Program restrictions and other terms and conditions apply. LENDER AND MONOGRAM LLC EACH RESERVES THE RIGHT TO MODIFY OR DISCONTINUE PRODUCTS AND BENEFITS AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE. TERMS, CONDITIONS AND RATES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.
- Interest rates and APRs (Annual Percentage Rates) depend upon (1) the student’s and cosigner’s (if applicable) credit histories, (2) the repayment option and repayment term selected, (3) the expected number of years in deferment, (4) the requested loan amount and (5) other information provided on the online loan application. If approved, applicants will be notified of the rate applicable to your loan. Rates and terms are effective as of 7/1/24. The variable interest rate for each calendar month is calculated by adding 30-Day Average Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) index, or a replacement index if the SOFR index is no longer available, plus a fixed margin assigned to each loan. The SOFR index is published on the website of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The current SOFR index is 5.33% as of 7/1/24. The applicable index or margin for variable rate loans may change over time if the SOFR index changes or if a new index is chosen, and result in a different APR than shown. The fixed rate and APR assigned to a loan will never change except as required by law or if you request and qualify for the auto pay discount. The APR typically differs from the interest rate since it accounts for fees, the rate, length of the loan and the timing of all payments and reflects the cost as a yearly rate.
- APRs displayed as a range in the rate table assume a $10,000 loan with one disbursement. The high APRs assume a 7-year term with the Flat Payment Repayment option, a 1 month deferment period, and a six-month grace period before entering repayment. The low APRs assume a 7-year term, and the Immediate Repayment option with payments beginning 30-60 days after the disbursement via auto pay (see auto pay details in Discounts footnote below).
- Loan Terms: The 15-year term is only available for loan amounts of $5,000 or more. Certain repayment terms and/or options may not be available depending on the applicant’s enrollment status and/or debt-to-income ratio. Payment examples (all assume a 14-month deferment period, a six-month grace period before entering repayment, no rate reduction for auto pay and the Interest Only Repayment option): 7-year term: $10,000 loan, one disbursement, with a 7-year repayment term (84 months), and 9.50% APR would result in a monthly principal and interest payment of $163.44. 10-year term: $10,000 loan, one disbursement, with a 10-year repayment term (120 months) and 9.30% APR would result in a monthly principal and interest payment of $128.31. 15-year term: $10,000 loan, one disbursement, with a 15-year repayment term (180 months) and 9.29% APR would result in a monthly principal and interest payment of $103.16.
- Loan Amounts: The minimum loan amount is $1,000 except for student applicants who are permanent residents of Iowa in which case the minimum loan amount is $1,001. The maximum annual loan amount to cover in-school expenses for each academic year is determined by the school’s cost of attendance, minus other financial aid, such as federal student loans, scholarships, or grants, up to $99,999 annually. The loan amount must be certified by the school. The loan amount cannot cause the aggregate maximum student loan debt (which includes federal and private student loans) to exceed $180,000 per applicant (on cosigned applications, separate calculations are performed for the student and cosigner).
- Monthly Payment During School: This is the estimated monthly payment that will be made during the time you remain enrolled at the level of attendance your school certifies, subject to the initial deferment period maximum of 66 months from the first disbursement date. Immediate Repayment: Starting 30-60 days after your first disbursement date the first monthly payment of principal and interest will be due. The monthly payments of principal and interest will be generally stable for twelve months and will be recalculated once each year and reset annually on the anniversary of your most recent repayment start date so as to pay the loan in full over the remaining repayment period. Full Deferment: Principal and interest payments will be deferred from your first disbursement date through your initial deferment period end date. Starting 30-60 days after the initial deferment period, the first monthly payments of principal and interest will be due unless you qualify for and request an additional type of deferment. Interest Only Repayment: Principal payments will be deferred from your first disbursement date through your initial deferment period end date. Starting 30-60 days after your first disbursement date you will pay interest-only monthly payments that are equal to the accrued interest on the outstanding principal balance throughout the initial deferment period. Flat Payment Repayment during school: Principal payments will be deferred from your first disbursement date through your initial deferment period end date. Starting 30-60 days after your first disbursement date you will pay a minimum amount of $25 in interest per month through your initial deferment period end date. For all repayment options, any accrued and unpaid interest (interest that is in excess of the amount paid each month) will be added to the outstanding principal balance and may be capitalized at the beginning of your repayment period.
- Monthly Payment After Graduation: Immediate Repayment: This is the estimated combined monthly principal and interest payment amount following the final disbursement of your loan The monthly payment amount shown in the estimate will increase or decrease if the interest rate increases or decreases and will be computed based on the interest rate applicable at the time repayment begins. Your monthly payment amount may also be recalculated (a) after any deferment or forbearance period, (b) after you ask the servicer to change the monthly payment due date or (c) if the minimum monthly payment is not enough to cover the interest accrued during that month. Full Deferment, Interest Only Repayment and Flat Payment during school: The Estimated Monthly Payment after Graduation is the combined principal and interest payment amount following the initial deferment period. The first year of principal and interest repayment generally has the same monthly payment each month. After the first year of principal and interest payments, monthly payment amounts are recalculated once each year and reset annually on the anniversary of your most recent repayment start date so as to pay the loan in full over the remaining repayment period. The monthly payment amount shown in the estimate will increase or decrease if the interest rate increases or decreases and will be computed based on the interest rate applicable at the time repayment begins. Your monthly payment amount may also be recalculated (a) after any deferment or forbearance period, (b) after you ask the servicer to change the monthly payment due date, or (c) if the minimum monthly payment is not enough to cover the interest accrued during that month. For all repayment options, the minimum monthly payments of your loan’s combined principal and interest will be at least $50.
- Graduation Reward: The principal reduction is based on the total dollar amount of all disbursements made, excluding any amounts that are reduced, canceled, or returned. To receive this principal reduction, it must be requested from the Servicer, the student borrower must have earned a bachelor’s degree or higher and proof of such graduation must be provided to the Servicer. This reward is available once during the life of the loan, regardless of whether the student receives more than one degree.
- Cosigner Release: A cosigner may be released from the loan upon request to the Servicer, provided that the student borrower has met certain credit and other criteria, and 36 consecutive monthly principal and interest payments have been received by the Servicer within 10 calendar days after their due date. Late payment(s), or the use of a deferment or forbearance will reset the number of consecutive principal and interest payments to zero. Use of an approved reduced repayment plan will disqualify the loan from being eligible for this benefit.
- Discounts: Auto Pay yields a 0.25% interest rate reduction for making automatic payments of principal and interest from a bank account (“auto pay discount”) by completing the direct debit form provided by the Servicer. The auto pay discount will be applied after the Servicer validates your bank account information. Automatic payments and the associated discount will be temporarily discontinued (1) if you elect to stop automatic deduction of payments and (2) during periods when you are not required to make payments. The discount will be permanently discontinued in the event three automatic deductions are returned by the financial institution for any reason. The auto pay discount is not available when reduced payments are being made or when the loan is in a deferment. Please note that if the discount filter in the Offer Dashboard is turned “on”, the interest rate and APR estimates quoted on the Offer Dashboard will include the auto pay discount. The auto pay discount will not be reflected in the contract or disclosures you receive from the Lender because you must request and qualify for the auto pay discount.
- Past Due Balances: Applications may be accepted up to the earlier of (a) twelve calendar months after the Applicant’s academic period end date or (b) twelve calendar months after the Applicant’s graduation date.

- What is a private student loan?
- A private student loan is a loan used to cover qualifying academic-related expenses. You can take out private student loans through banks, online lenders, credit unions and sometimes through colleges and state agencies. These usually have higher borrowing limits than federal student loans and may offer lower interest rates for borrowers with good credit, but they come with fewer borrower protections.
- How private student loans work
- To qualify, you’ll need to meet the lender’s eligibility requirements and go through a credit check. Applicants with good or excellent credit tend to get the lowest interest rates. Because undergraduates usually don’t have extensive credit histories, they typically need a co-signer to take out a private student loan.
- Some lenders specialize in student loans without a co-signer for undergraduates. To determine your eligibility and rate, they may evaluate your performance in school, earning potential, work history and more.
- Unlike other types of loans, you likely won't receive the funds. Instead, they'll be sent to your school or college. From there, you can use the money for academic-related expenses, like technology, room and board and tuition.
- Pros and cons of private student loans
- Before applying for a private student loan, consider the benefits and drawbacks of this type of financing.
- Higher borrowing limits than federal loans
- Low interest rates for good credit
- More flexible enrollment options than federal loans allow
- Standard requirement for scores in the mid-600s compared to no minimum required by federal loans
- High rates for bad credit borrowers
- Income-driven repayment plans generally not available
- Private vs. federal student loans
- While private and federal student loans are both viable ways to pay for college, there are some differences to keep in mind:
- Ask the experts: When should you choose a private student loan over a federal one?
- Student Loans and Student Aid Expert, College Admissions and Financial Aid
- "Students should borrow federal first, because federal student loans are cheaper, more available and have better repayment terms.
- Private student loans are an option when a borrower exhausts the federal loan limits, which range from $5,500 to $7,500 for dependent students, depending on the year in school (and $9,500 to $12,500 for independent students). If a borrower reaches these loan limits, their main options are private or parent loans.
- But, needing to borrow more than the federal student loan limits may be a sign that you are borrowing too much money. You should aim to borrow no more than your annual starting salary for your entire education. If total student debt is less than annual income, you should be able to repay your student loans in ten years or less.
- If you do need to borrow parent or private loans, compare the interest rates, fees and other benefits on both types of loans. Shop around for the lowest interest rate. If you have an excellent credit score, or a cosigner with excellent credit, you may be able to qualify for a lower rate on a private student loan than a Federal Parent PLUS loan."
- Writer, Personal Loans and Debt Relief
- "There are very few instances in which you would want to choose a private student loan over a federal loan right off the bat. Unlike private loans, federal student loans aren't credit-based and come with hardship repayment and forgiveness options. Plus, they have the same, fixed rates for every borrower. However, they do come with maximum borrowing amounts that often don't cover the entire cost for the semester. Borrowers often turn to private loans after maximizing their federal aid to fill any financing gaps — this is the recommended route for most individuals. The only time a private loan is recommended over a federal loan is for those who have excellent credit and qualify for a lower rate with a private loan."
- How to get a private student loan
- Here's what you can expect from most private student loan applications:
- Look for loans specific to your program or needs: Some lenders offer loans that are specific to medical school, an apprenticeship, a business degree and more, and it may be best to start with lenders that specialize in your degree. If you don't have anyone willing to co-sign, you should also narrow your search to lenders that have no-co-signer options.
- Prequalify: Most lenders offer prequalification before officially applying. This allows you to see your predicted eligibility odds and potential loan terms, without impacting your credit score. It's recommended that you prequalify with at least two lenders to get an idea of what a competitive rate looks like for your credit situation before you choose a lender.
- Compare rates and terms: Once you have your rate offers, you'll be able to pick from a variety of interest rates and repayment terms. A low interest rate may be the deciding factor, but you should also use a calculator to compare the overall cost of your loan with each lender.
- Apply: Online lenders offer fully online applications, while some banks or credit unions offer in person assistance at a physical location. If you come across a question while filling out the application, look up the lender's customer service phone number or email to receive customized assistance.

Application Process:
- Only the borrower may apply for cosigner release. To do so, they must first meet the age of majority in their state and provide proof of graduation (or completion of certification program), income, and U.S. citizenship or permanent residency (if their status has changed since they applied). In the last 12 months, the borrower can’t have been past due on any loans serviced by Sallie Mae for 30 or more days or enrolled in any hardship forbearances or modified repayment programs. In addition, the borrower must have paid ahead or made 12 on-time principal and interest payments on each loan requested for release. The loan can’t be past due when the cosigner release application is processed. The borrower must also demonstrate the ability to assume full responsibility of the loan(s) individually and pass a credit review when the cosigner release application is processed that demonstrates a satisfactory credit history including but not limited to no: bankruptcy, foreclosure, student loan(s) in default or 90-day delinquencies in the last 24 months. Requirements are subject to change.
- For applications submitted directly to Sallie Mae, loan amount cannot exceed the cost of attendance less financial aid received, as certified by the school. Applications submitted to Sallie Mae through a partner website will be subject to a lower maximum loan request amount. Miscellaneous personal expenses (such as a laptop) may be included in the cost of attendance for students enrolled at least half-time.

- Bankrate Score = 4.8/5Bankrate scores are objectively determined by our editorial team. Our scoring formula weighs several factors consumers should consider when choosing financial products and services.
- The range of loan amounts that a lender will service. The maximum value is the largest amount a lender will give although this amount may not be available to borrowers who don’t have good or excellent credit. Amount ranges may vary for non-loan products. Term refers to the amount of time you have to repay the loan.
- ELFI offers some of the most comprehensive customer service on the market. Applicants are assigned a dedicated student loan advisor to assist them throughout the lending process after submitting an application.
- Be the age of majority in state of residence at the time of application
- Have a minimum annual income of $35,000
- Have a minimum credit score of 680
- Have a minimum credit history of 36 months
- Higher credit score requirement
- ELFI Program from SouthEast Bank – Loan Interest Rates & Fees
- Your Starting Interest Rate (upon approval)
- The interest rate you pay will be determined after you apply. It will be based upon your credit history, the loan term you select, and other factors. If approved, we will notify you of the rate you qualify for.
- Your Interest Rate during the life of a loan: Fixed-Rate Loans
- Your rate is fixed and will depend on the loan term that you select. This means that your interest rate will never change during the life of your loan.
- Your Interest Rate during the life of the loan: Variable-Rate Loans*
- Your rate is variable. This means that your rate could move lower or higher than the rates on your disclosure. Although the interest rate will vary after you are approved, the interest rate will never exceed 18% for the 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, or 15-year term. Your loan amount will not exceed the cost of attendance less financial aid as certified by your school. For variable rate loans applied for after 7:00 PM EST on January 7, 2022, the variable interest rate will be based on a publicly available index, the Prime Rate of Interest as published in the Money Market Section of the Wall Street Journal. These variable rates will be calculated and set each month by adding a margin between -2.50% to 5.72% to the Prime Rate. If you have an existing variable rate loan that uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate index, your loan will continue to use the LIBOR as the benchmark rate index. These rates will be calculated by adding a margin between 1.05% to 11.39% to the 3-month LIBOR. Your rate will not increase more than once quarterly. ELFI will notify borrowers with existing variable rate loans originated prior to 7:00 PM EST on January 7, 2022, of the expected change from LIBOR to the Prime Rate in the future.
- Loan Fees & Example
- Application Fee: $0
- Loan Guarantee Fee: 0%
- Returned Check or Insufficient Funds Charge: $30 For example, a 10-year loan with a fixed rate of 7% would have 120 payments of $11.61 per $1,000 borrowed. Rates are subject to change.
- Federal Loan Alternatives and Disclosure Regarding Benefits
- You may qualify for federal education loans. For additional information, contact your school’s financial aid office or the Department of Education at: www.studentloans.gov & studentaid.ed.gov/sa
- Think carefully before taking out a loan with ELFI. You are encouraged to start with grants, scholarships, savings, and federal student loans before utilizing private student loans. Federal student loans offer deferment and forbearance options that may not be available to you if you take out a loan with ELFI.
- Private education loans are not eligible to be included in a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan.
- See https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/loans/federal-vs-private for a description of the benefits and repayment options available to federal student loan borrowers.
- 1. Find out about other options. The Federal Direct Consolidation Loan may have student loan benefits and terms not detailed on this form. Visit the Department of Education’s website at www.StudentLoans.gov for more information about other consolidation loans. 2. To apply for this loan, complete the application. If you are approved for this loan, the loan terms will be available for 30 days (terms will not change during this period, except as permitted by law).
- Interest Rate: Your interest rate will depend on the loan term that you select. Interest rates are valid within the preceding 30 days.
- Immediate: The borrower starts repaying the loan while still in school. The monthly payment will cover the monthly interest and some of the principal borrowed. This option will have the highest monthly payments while in school, but will save the borrower the most money throughout the life of the loan.
- Fixed: The borrower pays a fixed monthly payment of $25.00 while in school and grace period. This amount will first be applied to interest, and any leftover will be applied to the principal. Any unpaid interest will be added to the principal balance of the loan upon the end of the borrowers grace period.
- Interest Only: The borrower makes monthly payments to cover the monthly interest while the borrower is in school and grace period. These payments will not include any payment toward the principal of the loan. The principal balance will remain unchanged unless the borrower pays extra.
- Deferred: The borrower makes no monthly payments while in school and grace period. The loan will accrue interest while the borrower is in school and grace period. Upon the end of the grace period, the accrued interest will be added to the principal amount of the loan. Depending on the repayment option you select, your loan may defer payment of principal and/or interest while you are enrolled at least half-time at a post-secondary educational institution. If your loan includes a deferment period, interest will accrue from the disbursement of the loan through the end of the deferment period. Any accrued but unpaid interest during that time will be added to the loan’s principal balance. The lender does not offer payment deferral options once your full payments of principal and interest begin. The lender may in its sole discretion agree to modify the loan or extend other repayment assistance to you on request.
- Accept the loan terms: Once you're approved, your lender will communicate with your school to verify the cost of attendance. This certification process may take a few weeks. At that point, funds will be disbursed to your school for tuition and fees and any remaining amount will be sent to you personally.
- Alternatives to student loans
- Before jumping into a student loan to cover the costs associated with a degree, consider options that can help reduce the overall cost. Grants and scholarships are two of the most common alternatives, but unlike loans, they don't need to be repaid.
- Many schools offer tuition assistance programs for students with household incomes below a certain maximum who can maintain a specific GPA through their academic career. These institutions may also offer payment plans that allow you to make smaller, interest-free payments over time.
- Federal need-based financial aid should also be explored before looking at private loans. Borrowers can apply for government-sponsored grants and programs — like work-study — through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). Many states also offer student aid programs, including grants and scholarships beyond the federal level.
- Aside from financial aid, students should talk to their parents or other support systems to see if there are funds saved in a 529 plan, or ask if they can get help paying for books and other supplies. They can also receive income by working a part-time or on-campus job while in school or save on room and board by becoming a resident assistant (RA).
- Repaying a private student loan
- Generally, you don't need to worry about repaying your student loan until after you graduate and your grace period ends. A standard grace period is six months after you graduate or drop below half-time enrollment, but it may be longer with some private lenders.
- With many private companies, you have the option of making payments on your loan while you're in school to decrease how much interest accumulates. Once your funds are disbursed, you may have the option to make interest-only payments or a small flat monthly payment. You may also have the opportunity to refinance your private student loan to help manage your payments.
- By refinancing, you can reduce your interest rate and extend or reduce your term, depending on your financial goals. While you can refinance your federal student loans, it is not recommended. By refinancing your federal loans into private student loans, you lose the benefits of federal loans, which include income-driven repayment plans and potential loan forgiveness.
- FAQs about private student loans
- Can I get a private student loan with bad credit?
- If you have bad credit, it’s best to start by applying for federal student loans, since these don't have credit requirements. If you still need funding from private student loans, you may need a cosigner to qualify. Cosigner responsibilities include footing the bill if you fall behind on payments, so make sure they understand what they’re getting into before signing up. You can also start by searching for lenders specializing in loans for borrowers with bad credit.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-calculator


Application Process:
- 6 steps to calculate your payments using a mortgage calculator
- Here’s how to use our mortgage calculator to easily estimate payments:
- Enter your loan term. In the Loan term field, enter the length of your loan — usually 30 years, but could be 20, 15 or 10.
- Enter your interest rate. In the Interest rate field, input the rate you expect to pay or are currently paying. Our calculator defaults to the current average rate, but you can adjust this percentage.
- Bankrate's calculator also estimates property taxes, homeowners insurance and homeowners association fees. You can edit these amounts, or even edit them to zero, as you're shopping for a loan.
- In addition, the calculator allows you to input extra payments (under the “Amortization” tab). This can help you decide whether to prepay your mortgage and by how much.
- Typical costs included in a mortgage payment
- Your mortgage payment is largely comprised of principal and the interest. Here's what that means, along with other definitions related to your loan:
- Interest: This is what the lender charges you to borrow the principal, or loan amount. Interest rates are expressed as an annual percentage.
- Down payment: This is the portion of the home’s price you’re not financing with a mortgage. For many borrowers, this is as little as 3 percent.
- Closing costs: Closing costs are one-time fees associated with getting a mortgage. They include the lender's origination fee (if it charges one), recording fees and fees for settlement and title services. Altogether, these typically run 2 percent to 5 percent of the mortgage and are usually paid by or on the day the loan closes.
- Property taxes: This is the tax on your home levied by your city or town, paid for as long as you own it. If your mortgage lender requires an escrow account, you'll pay a portion of your annual property tax bill with each monthly mortgage payment.
- Homeowners insurance: Your insurance policy helps protect you financially from damage related to covered events. If you live in a flood or other disaster-prone zone, you'll be required to have additional coverage. As with property taxes, you'll pay a portion of your annual insurance premium each month with your mortgage payment.
- Mortgage insurance: If you’re getting a conventional or FHA loan and your down payment is less than 20 percent of the home's purchase price, you'll pay mortgage insurance premiums, which are also added to your monthly payment.
- Mortgage payment formula
- For the mathematically inclined, here's a formula to help you calculate mortgage payments manually:
- This formula can help you crunch the numbers to see how much house you can afford. Alternatively, you can use this mortgage calculator to help determine your budget.
- How a mortgage calculator can help you
- Our mortgage calculator can help guide many of the decisions related to buying a home or refinancing your mortgage, such as:
- Whether you're spending more than you can afford: Use the calculator to see how much you’ll pay each month, including in homeowners insurance premiums and property taxes. This can help you determine if you’re stretching your homebuying budget too far, or paying too much in terms of debt-to-income (DTI ratio).
- Whether your budget allows for a shorter-term loan: Use the calculator to compare the monthly payments and total interest between a 10-, 15-, 20-  or 30-year loan. Shorter-term loans come with lower interest rates, but higher monthly payments.
- Whether you should put more or less money down: Use the calculator to weigh different down payment scenarios and how that’ll affect how much you’ll borrow and pay.
- Whether you should pay off your mortgage early: Use the calculator to learn how extra payments can impact how quickly you’ll repay the loan and  any interest savings.
- When you can get rid of mortgage insurance: Use the calculator’s amortization schedule to determine when you’ll hit 20 percent equity — the magic number you need on a conventional loan to request that your lender remove private mortgage insurance (PMI).
- If you're not sure how much of your income should go toward housing, it might help to start with the 28/36 rule, which dictates you spend no more than 28 percent of your gross income on housing costs and no more than 36 percent of your gross income on overall debt, including housing costs.
- Say Joe makes $60,000 a year. That's a gross monthly income of $5,000 a month. Twenty-eight percent of that equals $1,400. If Joe were to abide by the 28/36 rule, he’d spend no more than $1,400 on a mortgage payment each month.
- “Many prospective homeowners are tempted to 'stretch' when buying a home since it can literally be the culmination of a dream,” says Mark Hamrick, Bankrate senior economic analyst. “At the same time, given that this is one of the most expensive and consequential purchases of a lifetime, the transaction needs to co-exist with our many other financial goals including saving for retirement, saving for emergencies and paying down debt.
- “Being conservative and cautious with a home purchase is advisable,” Hamrick says. “If it turns out that income rises down the road, that presents an opportunity to sock money away to pay for repairs, maintenance and renovations later.”
- How to lower your monthly mortgage payment
- If the monthly payment you're seeing in our calculator looks a bit out of reach, you can try some tactics to reduce the hit. Play with a few of these variables:
- Choose a longer loan. With a longer term, your payment will be lower (but you'll pay more interest over the life of the loan).
- Spend less on the home. Borrowing less translates to a smaller monthly mortgage payment.
- Shop for a lower interest rate. You don't have to get your mortgage from your bank. Comparing offers from a few lenders can help you uncover the lowest rates.
- Make a bigger down payment. This is another way to reduce the size of the loan.
- Next steps on getting a mortgage
- A mortgage calculator is a springboard to help you estimate your monthly mortgage payment and understand what it includes. Once you have a good idea of your budget, you might move on to these next steps:
- Get a mortgage prequalification or preapproval.
- Apply for a mortgage
- Additional mortgage resources
- How to get a mortgage
- Types of mortgages
- First-time homebuyers guide
- Compare mortgage rates for different loan types

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/how-to-build-equity-in-your-home


Application Process:
- There are various ways to build equity in your home more quickly. The process generally involves increasing your property’s value, decreasing your mortgage debt, or some combination of both. Below are a few options available to homeowners.
- Building equity starts the moment you fork over your down payment. Remember: Home equity equals the amount of your home you own outright, and you own outright what you actually pay out of pocket for (as opposed to financing with a loan). So, the more cash you contribute towards the home purchase, the bigger your ownership stake.
- Technically, you don’t own the percentage of the house you finance — the bank does. While it may be possible to buy a house with as little as 3 percent or even zero percent down, a larger down payment instantly boosts your home equity.
- When figuring your down payment though, consider how much savings you’ll have remaining after closing. Leaving yourself with little to no cash reserves makes it harder to handle any financial emergencies that arise and can even make it more challenging to cover your regular monthly mortgage payment. You’ll also need to account for home maintenance costs, which typically run about 1 percent of the home’s value in the first year.
- If you can put down at least 20 percent on the home purchase, you’ll also avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI) each month. It’s an additional surcharge built into your mortgage payment — a burden you don’t need. Avoiding having PMI (or MIP if it’s a government-backed loan) added to your mortgage payment can free up funds each month and can help increase your home equity.
- 2. Get the cheapest loan possible
- Maybe it’s stating the obvious. Who doesn’t want a less-expensive loan? But it plays a part in equity-building, too: The faster you can pay down the loan principal, the quicker your equity stake increases. So you want to pay as little in interest as possible.
- To that end, shop around for mortgages — studies show that those who do are more likely to save money — and for different types of mortgages, as some typically carry lower interest rates. Consider a mortgage with a term shorter than the traditional 30 years, for example: Not only is its interest rate lower, but you settle the debt sooner. You might consider an adjustable-rate mortgage, which also carries lower interest rates for several years. Just resist the temptation to make interest-only payments during that period.
- When you take out a mortgage, you may get an offer from your lender to roll any closing costs into the loan itself. Admittedly, it’s tempting, as these up-front expenses can often amount to several thousand dollars — as much as 5 percent of your loan. But, doing so adds to the monthly amount (the loan principal and the interest) you owe.
- Paying closing costs and other upfront fees right away, if you can afford it, is a more economical move. It will help boost your equity because it means more of your dollars are going toward the loan principal, and it keeps the principal (and the amount of interest charged on it) smaller. This strategy applies to a mortgage, but it can also apply if you refinance your mortgage, which also incurs closing costs and fees.
- 5. Pay more on your mortgage
- Most mortgages are on an amortization schedule, meaning you make payments in installments over a set period of time until the loan is paid off. As you pay down the mortgage, your equity stake increases. While you’ll always pay both principal and interest, a larger portion of the payment goes toward interest initially, and then more goes toward the principal over time.
- However, if you make extra payments toward the principal every month, you build home equity quicker by decreasing the overall total owed on the debt. If you have the means to pay a little extra, call your loan servicer and ask how to do it. Check your monthly statements to make sure the extra money goes toward the principal.
- Here are a few ways to pay your mortgage off faster:
- Switch to biweekly mortgage payments. Split your mortgage payment in half and send each half every two weeks instead of once at the end of the month. This adds one extra payment to your mortgage every year, which can ultimately shorten your loan term and save you money on interest.
- Add a certain amount each month. Check your budget to see how much extra you can realistically put toward your mortgage every month. For example, if you just paid off your car loan, consider putting that extra $250 toward the mortgage every month.
- Use windfall funds. Any time you receive a tax refund, a bonus at work, or a cash gift, put it toward your mortgage balance.
- 6. Refinance to a shorter loan term
- A shorter loan term has two main benefits: You typically get a lower interest rate, and more of your mortgage payment goes toward the principal each month. Choosing a 15-year mortgage from the start helps you build more equity every month than you would with a 30-year mortgage, because you’re paying down the debt faster. If you already have a mortgage, you can refinance into a shorter-term loan.
- However, there’s a catch: Payments are higher on a shorter loan. Make sure there’s room in your budget for that larger mortgage payment before you opt for the shorter term loan or refinance to one.
- Also, because of their larger payments, shorter loans may be a tad tougher to get. To qualify, you’ll need a bigger income, higher credit score and lower debt-to-income ratio than you generally would with the traditional 30-year mortgage.
- If you’re refinancing your mortgage, don’t do a cash-out refinance. In a cash-out refi, you’re replacing your old mortgage with a bigger one; the extra money you receive outright in cash (hence the name). This amount is based on the value of the equity you currently have in the home.
- A cash-out refi can be useful. But in this case, it’s counterproductive. Stick to a rate-and-term refinance, which will potentially allow you to reap the rewards of a lower interest rate or a shorter-term mortgage while keeping your ownership stake intact.
- According to CoreLogic, home prices rose 4.5 percent in 2024, a small increase from 2023. While you don’t have much control over real estate market fluctuations or economic conditions, you can protect yourself from economic shifts somewhat. Keep your home in good condition, always. Avoid tapping your equity too much or too often — and when you do borrow against it, use the funds to enhance the home itself (with renovations like those described above) or to strengthen your finances (by paying off ongoing, high-interest debts).
- You can check your home’s value using an online price evaluator or by getting a professional appraisal. Bankrate offers an online home equity loan calculator to help you figure the worth of your equity stake.
- That’s bad news for homebuyers — but happy tidings for homeowners. As home prices have climbed, so has the worth of Americans’ home equity. According to CoreLogic’s Homeowner Equity Insights, homeowners with mortgages saw their equity increase by $425 billion since the third quarter of 2023, to about $311,000 per homeowner. About $207,000 of that is tappable, meaning it can be withdrawn while leaving 20 percent of the equity intact (as most lenders require you to do).
- The cost to tap into that wealth of equity may get easier this year. HELOCs and HE Loan rates started softening after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times in late 2024. Greg McBride, CFA, chief financial analyst for Bankrate, forecasts that both HELOCs and home equity loans will end 2025 lower, with HELOCs dropping to levels not seen since 2022.
- The rise in home prices has slowed somewhat, and so has the growth in equity stakes. But don’t expect a dramatic uptick in the amount of housing available for sale. Many existing homeowners will still be unwilling to put their homes on the market and lose the low interest rates they scored days of yore to buy a new place. Given this tight inventory, it’s not likely that values will decline substantially, if at all.
- “Housing unaffordability challenges are a modern fact of life,” says Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst for Bankrate. “Even if we see a modest decline in mortgage rates over the next year, that’s only going to slightly move the needle. For many aspiring homeowners, this will make a prospective purchase a continuing challenge.”
- Many homeowners nowadays are borrowing against their equity to get cash. Among current homeowners, 55 percent see home improvements or repairs as a good reason to tap home equity, according to Bankrate’s Home Equity Insights Survey. Nearly one-third (30 percent) cite debt consolidation — paying off credit cards or other high-interest obligations.
- “Home equity loan rates and HELOC rates are attractive because they tend to be lower than you would find with a personal loan or credit card,” says Bell. “And those rates became even more attractive as they dropped in 2024.”
- However, “to get those lower rates, you are putting your home on the line as collateral,” she notes. “Ensure you can take on the additional debt load because you can lose your home if you can’t keep up with payments.
- Overall, “it’s important to weigh the pros and cons of accessing your home equity before moving forward,” Bell says. Also, be sure to evaluate how quickly you can rebuild your equity. Because, whether it’s buoyed by a hot market or by paying off a mortgage — or both — a rich equity stake benefits a homeowner in a variety of ways, both long-term and for immediate aims.
- You start building equity as you start paying down your mortgage. It can take you between five and 10 years to build a significant equity stake in your home, but it depends on several factors. If home prices appreciate, your equity increases without you having to do anything. Making a larger down payment will give you more equity at the outset. You can also take matters into your own hands by making extra payments or bigger payments (making sure to allocate the extra amount towards the principal).
- How can I get equity out of my house with no income?
- You have to have some income to get home equity financing, because you need the means to repay the loan. Accessing the equity in your home with a low income might be difficult, but it’s not impossible. Reverse mortgages are designed for seniors at least 55 years of age or older on a fixed income and allow them to receive payments tax-free, with repayment delayed until they die or sell the home.  People with non-traditional income can benefit from no-doc HELOCs or home equity loans, as you won’t need to provide W2s or paystubs to verify your income. Instead, you still have to supply bank statements or 1099 forms. The income and credit score requirements for home equity sharing agreements (HEAs) are also not as stringent as you would find with HELOCs or home equity loans.

Application Process:
- At Bankrate, we aim to provide reliable personal finance information. We value your feedback.
- A HELOC is a revolving, open line of credit. It works much like a credit card — you are able to use it as needed, repay the funds and then tap it again. However, a HELOC has some benefits over credit cards. One is that the amount you can borrow on your HELOC is likely to be higher than the balance limit on your credit card (think five figures instead of four). Another is that HELOCs currently have single-digit interest rates, compared to the 16 percent or more you’ll pay if you carry a balance on a credit card.
- A word of caution: With a line of credit, it can be easy to get in over your head by using more money than you are prepared to pay back. The variable payments can also create financial challenges.
- Lower APRs than credit cards
- Potential boost to credit history
- Less paperwork and fees than a cash-out refinance
- Higher APRs than mortgages
- Home becomes collateral for the loan
- Borrower’s home equity stake is reduced
- You can use the proceeds from your HELOC for anything. That’s a lot of financial freedom, so it’s useful to have some guidelines about how to spend the money. A few options, and whether they make sense:
- Home improvements and repairs: Yes. Using home equity to pay for kitchen renovations and bathroom updates is a no-brainer. These upgrades add to functionality and (generally) the resale value of your home. If you need a new air conditioner, for example, a HELOC is cheaper than carrying a credit card balance. However, be careful about using HELOCs to add a swimming pool or tennis court — these additions are expensive, and homeowners usually don’t recoup the full amount of the investment.
- Consolidating debt: Maybe. If you’re carrying credit card debt and paying double-digit interest rates, it could make sense to swap out expensive revolving debt for cheaper HELOC debt. This strategy comes with a big caveat, however: Pull cash out of your house to pay off the credit cards only if you’re not going to simply run up more debt. Otherwise, you’ll have the unfortunate combination of less home equity and an overhang of credit card balances.
- Investing: Probably not. Tapping home equity at 3 percent to fatten up your retirement savings made sense. However, using a home equity line of credit at 7.5 percent today probably isn’t ideal. Additionally, proceed with caution when using a HELOC on an investment property. While you can access cash at a cheaper rate than other forms of borrowing, you could end up underwater if your property loses value.
- Paying down student loans: Maybe. This one is a bit of a gray area. If you want to pay for your child’s college education, it can make sense to tap into your home equity. The same goes if you still carry student loans from private lenders: In contrast to federal loans, private student loans carry higher rates and less flexibility. Federal loans have lower rates and more safeguards around financial hardships, so there’s no hurry to pay them down.
- HELOCs typically have variable rates, and the most relevant figure to you as a borrower is the APR, or annual percentage rate. It’s not uncommon for lenders to offer a low promotional rate for six months to a year. Your APR then will adjust to the market rate. After that, your HELOC rate will move up and down with interest rates.
- The age of the loan
- As you draw more funds from the line of credit, the amount of the minimum payment will rise (even though it only covers accrued interest, that interest is applying to a larger balance). Changes in the interest rate will also change your required payment. With most HELOCs, you can also opt to pay more than the minimum, to lower outstanding the balance during the draw period.
- Once the draw period ends, you’ll enter the repayment period. During this phase, which can be as long as 20 years, you’ll have to make payments that cover interest and a portion of the loan’s principal. That means your payment will increase when the draw period ends and the repayment period begins.
- Home equity loans vs. HELOCs
- Home equity loans and HELOCs are two types of loans that use the value of your house as collateral. They’re both considered second mortgages. The main difference between them is that with home equity loans you get one lump sum of money, whereas HELOCs are lines of credit that you can draw from as needed. While HELOC interest is only charged on the funds you withdraw, a home equity loan’s interest is charged on the entire amount.
- Additionally, with a home equity loan, you have a set repayment period and a fixed interest rate, meaning your monthly payment will never change. If you’re looking to spend as you go — and only pay for what you’ve borrowed, when you’ve borrowed it — a HELOC is probably a better option. Conversely, if you know exactly how much you need upfront, a home equity loan could be a better option than a HELOC.
- HELOC vs. mortgage refinance
- A HELOC isn’t the only way to tap your home equity for cash. You also can use a cash-out refinance to raise money for renovations or other uses. A cash-out refi replaces your existing mortgage with a new mortgage that’s larger than your current outstanding balance. You receive the difference in a lump sum of cash when the new loan closes. Many lenders let you refinance and borrow up to 80 percent of your home’s value.
- In 2021, when mortgage rates were at record lows, the smart move was to take a cash-out refi and lock in a super-low rate. However, the sharp runup in mortgage rates in 2022 and 2023 makes a cash-out refinance an unattractive option – you trade in your entire mortgage balance for a new rate. If you locked in a mortgage rate of 3 percent, for instance, a new cash-out refinance now likely won’t make sense.
- A HELOC lets you keep your old mortgage intact. So only the new funds you draw from it are based on higher rates. A HELOC also tends to come with fewer fees and closing costs than a cash-out refi.
- HELOC payments tend to get more expensive over time. There are two reasons for this: adjustable rates and entering the repayment phase of the loan.
- HELOCs are variable-rate loans, which means your interest rate will adjust periodically. In a rising-rate environment, this could mean larger monthly payments.
- Additionally, once the draw period ends borrowers are responsible for both the principal and interest. This steep rise in the monthly HELOC payment can be a shock to borrowers who were making interest-only payments for the first 10 or 15 years. Sometimes the new HELOC payment can double or even triple what the borrower was paying for the last decade.
- To save money, borrowers can refinance their HELOC. Here we’ll take a look at two options and how they work.
- Home Equity Loan - You can take out a home equity loan, which has a fixed rate, and use this new loan to pay off the HELOC. The advantage of doing this is that you could dodge those rate adjustments. The disadvantage is that you would be responsible for paying closing costs.
- New HELOC - Apply for a new HELOC to replace the old one. This allows you to avoid that principal and interest payment while keeping your line of credit open. If you have improved your credit since you got the first HELOC, you might even qualify for a lower interest rate.
- If you’re interested in refinancing with a HELOC or home equity loan, use Bankrate’s home equity loan rates table to see current rates.
- Refinancing your HELOC into a home equity loan
- Some HELOCs give you the option, when the draw period ends, to refinance into a fixed-rate debt product — a home equity loan. (You can also look into doing this during the draw period, of course.) If you’re looking for certainty around payment amounts and interest rates, it might make sense to refinance a HELOC into a home equity loan.
- The advantage of doing this is that you could dodge those rate adjustments. The disadvantage is that you would incur closing costs on the home equity loan.
- During the draw period, you have several repayment options. Many HELOCs allow borrowers to make interest only payments during the draw period, which can vary. But of course you can make more than the minimum payment, if you choose — decreasing the outstanding balance on the credit line.
- HELOC repayment periods can last for decades. You have the option to repay on that schedule, or you can try to pay it off sooner, and terminate the arrangement. You might even pay it all off during the draw period, if you’re confident you won’t need any more funds. However, some HELOC lenders charge a fee for ending early; these  prepayment penalties are usually a few hundred dollars. Before you commit to a line of credit, be sure you read and understand the fine print. — that’s where prepayment fee info is usually buried. By law, lenders have to indicate if they impose one, but bear in mind that it could be called something else, such as an “early termination fee.”

Application Process:
- The final page also explains other parts of the mortgage payment process and your responsibilities as the borrower. This spells out, for instance, your appraisal and homeowners insurance requirements, whether or not the loan can be assumed, any late payment penalties and whether the loan will be serviced by the lender or sold to a separate entity that will service it.
- Even after you accept a mortgage offer, hang onto the loan estimate. It’s important to compare the information on it with the figures you receive in your closing disclosure, a breakdown of final expenses and costs you’ll receive at least three business days before the mortgage closing.
- How to compare mortgage loan estimates

Financial Tips:
- Prepayment penalty: Stipulates if your lender charges a fee if you choose to pay off your mortgage before the original loan term ends
- Balloon payment: Stipulates if there is a large principal payment due when the loan term ends
- Payment calculation: This shows the costs that make up your monthly mortgage payment, including principal and interest, and payments toward escrow and private mortgage insurance (PMI), if applicable.
- Estimated total monthly payment: This totals the components that go into your estimated regular mortgage payments.
- Estimated cash to close: This includes closing costs, plus any additional money you’ll have to pay upfront — like the down payment — and minus your earnest money deposit, any seller concessions, if buying a home, along with lender credits.
- Loan estimate example: Page 2
- This section offers a detailed list of services related to the creation of your loan and how much you’ll pay for each.
- A: Origination charges: Most lenders charge a fee for initiating the mortgage, which can include fees for the application and other services, plus any mortgage points you’re buying to lower your interest rate.
- B: Services you cannot shop for: This details a series of services you must pay for as quoted to close the mortgage, such as an appraisal and a credit check.
- D: Total loan costs: This is the sum of parts A, B and C.
- E: Taxes and other government fees: This includes fees for recording the mortgage with the city or county, as well as property transfer taxes, if applicable.
- F: Prepaids: This section explains the amount of your homeowners insurance premiums, mortgage insurance premiums, interest and property taxes that you’ll pay at closing.
- The final section on the second page of the loan estimate, “Calculating cash to close,” sets out each cost you’ll have to pay at the closing, including the down payment and total closing costs calculated in part J of the estimate document. This is the full estimated amount of cash you’re required to have on hand when you close on your mortgage.
- Loan estimate example: Page 3
- The final page of the loan estimate lists more important details of your mortgage agreement, like the names of the lender and the loan officer. The eighth section also lists three key figures you can use when comparing loan offers:
- Amount of the loan principal you will have paid off after the first five years of your mortgage term, as well as the combined principal, interest and mortgage insurance costs, if applicable
- The loan’s annual percentage rate, or APR, which is the total cost of your loan expressed as a rate. Because this includes closing costs, among other charges, it will be higher than your interest rate.
- Total interest percentage, or TIP, which is the amount of interest you’ll pay over the term of the loan, calculated as a percentage.
- When comparing offers between mortgage lenders, follow these tips:
- Note any third-party fees that appear in one lender’s loan estimate and not another’s.
- Look for any lender credits you were promised verbally. If they don’t appear on the loan estimate, ask your loan officer for clarification.
- If you’re refinancing, keep an eye out for any differences in the loan amount between lenders. If you’re obtaining a no-closing cost refinance, make sure you understand how those closing costs are accounted for.
- The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) recommends comparing at least three lenders. Comparing multiple lenders will help you find the best lender for your needs and the lowest interest rate.
- What is the seven-day rule for loan estimates?
- The seven-day rule for loan estimates requires lenders to provide the original loan estimate to the borrower at least seven business days before the loan’s closing date. It’s part of the TILA-RESPA Integrated Disclosure (TRID) rule.
- What is the seven-day rule for loan estimates?
- Does comparing loans affect your credit score?
- Comparing loan offers does affect your credit score, but only slightly. When you apply for multiple loans within a short period of time, it only counts as one hard credit inquiry. Your credit score should rebound quickly if you continue to pay your bills on time.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/taxes/trumps-latest-tax-proposal-no-taxes-for-those-earning-less-than-150000


Financial Tips:
- Lutnick also mentioned Trump’s plans to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime pay and Social Security. Other tax proposals that Trump floated in 2024 and earlier this year include creating a tax deduction for interest payments on car loans, and easing the income tax rules that expatriate Americans must follow.
- Also, the idea of eliminating taxes for those earning $150,000 or less may refer solely to income taxes, and likely wouldn’t eliminate the payroll taxes that U.S. workers pay toward Social Security and Medicare. A majority of taxpayers earning less than $200,000 pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes, according to a report by the Tax Foundation in 2019, based on data from the U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation.
- Meanwhile, Congress is currently debating the extension of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The sweeping legislation, initially enacted in 2017, during Trump’s first term, brought about lower income tax rates, a near-doubling of the standard deduction and a much more generous child tax credit, among other changes. All of these provisions are set to expire at the end of this year, unless Congress acts.
- No taxes on Social Security income
- While retirees with low incomes generally don’t owe taxes on their Social Security benefits, those who receive income from other sources, such as wages or rental income, may owe income tax on up to 85 percent of their benefits.
- However, tax cuts for Social Security could come at a price, according to experts. Exempting Social Security benefits from income tax would increase the budget deficit by $1.6 trillion over ten years and accelerate the trust fund’s insolvency, according to a report by the Tax Foundation.
- Ending taxes on tips and overtime pay
- Trump also has pledged to eliminate income taxes on tips and overtime income, but his administration hasn’t yet detailed how those plans will work.
- While it’s unclear precisely how Trump’s plan to end taxes on income of less than $150,000 would be implemented, he has vowed to change tax rules considerably during his second term.
- Here’s what Trump and Harris’ promise to eliminate tax on tips means for small businesses

====================================================================================================

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/loans/personal-loans/how-to-get-personal-loan

Eligibility Criteria:
- Shop around and only apply with lenders that clearly list personal and financial approval requirements that meet your needs. Most personal loan lenders allow you to check your predicted interest rates and eligibility odds before officially applying through a process called “prequalification.”
- This process doesn’t require a hard credit inquiry, which limits the overall negative impact to your credit. If you can’t prequalify and the minimum eligibility criteria aren’t listed on the website, you may want to try to contact the lender directly to get the information before applying to avoid damaging your credit with multiple hard inquiries.
- Compare several lenders and loan types to get an idea of what you qualify for. Avoid settling for the first offer you receive. If you’ve been a longtime account holder with your bank or credit union, see if it’s willing to give you a better rate or offer you any perks or discounts.
- 7. Pick a lender and apply

Application Process:
- If you have similar borrowing needs, you might wonder how to get a personal loan. In most cases, you just need a good credit score and proof of income to get a personal loan. Although getting a personal loan is relatively simple, there are some steps you can take to choose the right personal loan and increase your approval chances. The steps may vary depending on whether you’re looking for debt consolidation loans, home improvement loans, medical loans or wedding loans.
- How to get a personal loan in 9 steps
- Consumers often choose personal loans because they provide fast access to cash for a variety of needs. Whether you need money to pay for an unexpected hospital bill, an emergency car repair or to finance some much-needed home renovations, knowing how to get approved for a personal loan will help make the application process as smooth as possible.
- 1. Know your credit scores
- Check your credit score before you start crunching any numbers. Personal loan annual percentage rates (APRs) can range from just below 8 percent all the way up to 35.99 percent, depending mostly on your credit score. A score of 800 or higher puts in the excellent-credit personal loan rate category, while a score of 580 or below is typically categorized as bad.
- It’s more difficult to get approved for a loan with bad credit. Higher APRs mean higher payments. Lenders may not be willing to lend you as much, or they may require you to pay the loan off faster.
- On the other hand, a high credit score gives you the best chance at a low personal loan rate and a larger loan amount. You’re also more likely to be eligible for repayment terms as long as seven years, versus the standard five-year term offered to lower credit score borrowers.
- Pay your bills on time: Your payment history has the most impact on your credit score.
- Keep your credit card balances low: Pay off or pay down credit cards if you can. Your credit utilization ratio measures how much available revolving credit you’re carrying. The more maxed-out your cards are, the lower your score will be.
- Avoid opening new accounts: Your score dips a bit every time you apply for new credit. Limit new credit applications if you can.
- Before you get a loan, decide exactly how much you need to borrow. This will have an impact on the interest rate you’re offered, your monthly payment and the total amount of origination fees the lender charges.
- Some personal loan lenders charge origination fees over 10 percent of the amount you borrow, and the cost is typically deducted from your loan funds. Padding your loan amount before you apply may help you avoid reapplying for more to cover the costs later.
- Once you’ve zeroed in on your loan amount, run some numbers using a personal loan calculator. Experiment with longer terms if you want to keep your payment lower or shorter terms if you want to pay the balance off quickly.
- Check the websites of some personal loan lenders to get an idea of the rates and terms they offer. You should also check their rates and use them with a personal loan calculator to get the most accurate idea of what your monthly payment will be.
- 3. Review lender requirements and gather documentation
- Once you decide on the amount you want to borrow, you need to know what it will take to get approved by a personal loan lender. Each lender may set different approval requirements and collect a variety of documents to decide whether to take a risk on you as a borrower.
- Your credit score, income and debt are usually evaluated by personal loan lenders to see if you qualify. Some lenders may also consider your work history or education.
- Credit score and report: Most personal loan lenders require you to have fair credit, but there are options for those with bad credit. Your credit history may also be reviewed to see if there are major issues like prior bankruptcies or judgments. Some lenders will consider other criteria, such as your educational background and employment history, when reviewing your application.
- Debt-to-income ratio: Lenders also look at other monthly credit payments you make compared to how much you earn each month. This is known as your debt-to-income ratio and if it’s too high, you may not be approved for the amount you apply for.
- Income: Your income tells lenders how likely you are to be able to repay your loan. The more you make and the more regular your income is, the easier it is for the lender to approve your loan. Some, but not all, lenders allow you to get a co-signer, which may help boost the amount you’re approved for.
- Collateral: Although most personal loans are unsecured, some lenders may offer secured options. Collateral is another word for an asset like a car, jewelry or a fine art collection. Rates may be slightly lower with a secured loan, but the downside is you’ll lose your asset if you default on the loan.
- Researching lender requirements ahead of time will help you choose loans you have the best chance of getting approved for.
- You’ll need to provide documentation as part of the personal loan approval process to verify the information you provided on your application. Some lenders may be able to verify this information electronically, but most will ask you to provide:
- Income verification: You can provide a pay stub, bank statements, tax returns or even 1099 forms if you’re self-employed.
- Proof of address: Lenders want to confirm you have a verifiable address and where you’ve lived for the past few years. They may ask for copies of utility bills, lease or rental agreements, property tax bills or credit card statements as proof of address.
- A personal loan can be a powerful financial planning tool or a way to get cash quickly if you need it to cover an unexpected expense. Before you start researching personal loan types, think about how you can use the funds to improve your financial situation.
- One major benefit of personal loans is they can be funded quickly — sometimes as soon as one business day. If you’re facing a large unexpected expense like a car repair or an air conditioner replacement in your home, personal loans can get you needed funds fast.
- On the other hand, maybe you’re planning to buy a house in the future and want to simplify your expenses and improve your credit score. You could use a personal loan for debt consolidation to replace variable-rate credit cards with a fixed rate and payment. The future perk is your credit score could improve, allowing you to get a lower mortgage rate when you find your new home.
- Most personal loan terms range between one and seven years. A longer term will result in a lower monthly payment. However, lenders typically charge higher rates for longer terms, which leaves you paying more interest in the long run.
- Personal loan lenders typically charge lower rates for shorter terms, but the payments are much higher. Make sure your budget can handle the higher payment, and avoid short terms if you earn income from commissions or self-employment.
- Once you’ve picked the lender with the best offer for your needs, you’ll start the application process.
- You may be able to do the entire application process online. Alternatively, you may have to apply in person at your local bank or credit union branch. You’ll typically need to provide basic personal information and your income and employment information.
- Most lenders require that you state your intended loan purpose during the application process as well. Keep in mind the terms of your offer could change depending on the documents you provide. Ask the lender to explain any changes to your interest rate or loan amount after your initial application.
- Ultimately, Jared chose a lender because it was a good fit for his financial profile and allowed him to pay off his credit card debt balances directly with the loan funds. “Their credit score requirement was slightly lower than most, and with my subpar credit score, that made a big difference,” he adds.
- 8. Provide necessary documentation
- Every lender will have different paperwork requirements and once you submit your application, you may be asked to provide additional documentation. Be prepared to provide additional documents alongside the ones you prepared so the lender can verify information you provided on your application. Doing so can help avoid delays.
- Watch for changes to your terms that are a direct result of the documents you provided. Ask your lender to explain any differences in your rate, loan term or loan amount if they change after your prequalification offer.
- 9. Accept the loan and start making payments
- After the lender reviews your documents and notifies you that you’ve been approved, you’ll then finalize your loan documents by accepting the terms. Once you sign off on the loan agreement, you’ll typically get your funds within a week, although some online lenders get it to you within one or two business days.
- Keep track of when your payments are due, and consider setting up automatic payments to streamline the process. Some lenders even offer interest rate discounts if you use autopay.
- Also, consider paying extra each month, even if it’s only a small amount. While personal loans are often cheaper than credit cards, you’ll still save money on interest by paying the loan off early.
- Always make your monthly payments on time and try to make extra payments whenever possible. To make the process easier, enroll in automatic payments or set a due date reminder on your calendar.
- Getting approved for a personal loan is a simple process. You can increase your chances of approval by taking some steps ahead of time. Simple steps like knowing your credit score and understanding lender requirements could make the difference between a green light for financing or a loan denial. Take the time to research and compare lenders to find the best rates and terms for your specific financial situation.
- Wilder suggests understanding the fine print before you sign to avoid getting a loan that’s not a good fit. “You really should read up before you apply so you don’t get stuck in a situation that doesn’t actually fit your needs.”
- How to compare personal loans
- Best personal loan rates

Financial Tips:
- One of the best ways to improve your credit score is to pay off revolving debt like credit cards. If you don’t have the cash to pay them off, a personal loan is a great alternative to convert multiple credit card debts into one installment loan.
- Funds from a personal loan are received all at once, and your monthly payment is the same for the term of the loan. That may be a shock if you’re used to making minimum payments on a credit card.
- Also, if you don’t need the funds right away, a personal loan might not be the best fit because it locks you into a monthly payment whether you need the funds now or not. For example, if you’re planning some home improvement projects but plan to spread them out over the next year or two, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) allows you to use as much as you need for each project and the payment is only based on the credit balance you access.
- If your credit score is low because you have a lot of maxed-out credit cards, a personal loan for bad credit could help you pay those debts off and reduce your credit utilization ratio. Your scores could improve to the point where you can refinance to a better rate later, which will help reduce your overall monthly payments.
- Double-check your budget to make sure you can afford a fixed payment, and avoid short-term loans if your income varies.
- 5. Choose your loan type
- Personal loan lenders offer a variety of loan types to meet a variety of different needs. While some lenders are flexible in how you use the funds, others may only allow the money to be used for specific purposes. Before applying, check to make sure you can use the funds for what you need.
- Likewise, depending on the type of loan you get, you may get different terms and interest rates. For instance, home improvement loans tend to come with longer repayment terms than emergency loans, and debt consolidation loans tend to have lower starting APRs than general purpose loans.
- To make the most informed decision on what’s best for your finances, consider every type of personal loan available.
- Debt consolidation loans:Debt consolidation is one of the most common uses for personal loans. You take out one loan to cover multiple variable rate debts like credit cards and make only one payment at a potentially lower interest rate.
- Credit card refinancing loans: Some companies specialize in loans for people looking to pay off credit card debt. Because personal loan rates are often lower than credit card rates, this type of loan may save you hundreds or even thousands in interest charges over the life of the loan.
- Home improvement loans: A home improvement loan may be a good option to pay for a large renovation project without taking out a secured home equity loan.
- Medical loans: If you’re in a financial bind due to large medical expenses, a personal loan may be a good way to pay medical bills off and spread the payments out over a number of years.
- Emergency loans: Emergency loans are useful for urgent expenses such as a car breakdown, a smaller medical expense or a burst water pipe.
- Event loans: Although not recommended as a first-resort option, personal loans can be used as an alternative to using credit cards to finance weddings and vacations.
- Search the Bankrate personal loan marketplace to find the most competitive loan that best meets your borrowing needs.
- 6. Shop around for the best personal loan rates
- Shop around and only apply with lenders that clearly list personal and financial approval requirements that meet your needs. Compare several lenders and loan types to get an idea of what you qualify for. Avoid settling for the first offer you receive.
- If you’ve been a longtime account holder with your bank or credit union, see if it’s willing to give you a better rate or offer you any perks or discounts.

Application Process:
- Mr. Cooper supports a fairly seamless application process on its website and app. J.D. Power has given the lender lower marks for customer satisfaction, though, bringing its borrower experience score to 4.3 out of 5 stars.
- Preapproval and application process: Unlike many lenders with 30- or 60-day preapproval windows, Mr. Cooper’s preapproval lasts for 120 days, and its VerifiedApproval offering generates an approval letter when you’re ready to make an offer on a home. In addition, the lender’s StreetSmarts tool allows you to browse listings and set up property alerts, which could aid you in your home search. You can also use the lender’s app to check in on your application status.
- While Mr. Cooper has favorable reviews on Trustpilot (as of this review), it’s important to note its reputation has some blemishes: The lender’s track record with the Better Business Bureau includes more than 1,900 complaints in the past three years, and it came in well below average in J.D. Power’s latest customer satisfaction study of large mortgage originators.
- Borrowers on Bankrate have had mixed experiences obtaining a mortgage through Mr. Cooper, with some borrowers calling the application process “pretty easy” and “very simple,” but others characterizing it as “very difficult.”
- In 2024, Mr. Cooper completed its purchase of Flagstar Bank’s mortgage operations. As of this review, however, you can still apply for a home loan through the Flagstar website.
- Mortgage rates and fees can vary widely across lenders. You can use the drop downs to explore beyond these lenders and find the best option for you.
- Bankrate scores are objectively determined by our editorial team. Our scoring formula weighs several factors consumers should consider when choosing financial products and services.
- Mr. Cooper is a large national mortgage lender with a slick website, plenty of loan options and a special focus on FHA loans and first-time homebuyers. It hasn’t had the best feedback from customers, however — and that was before a security breach in 2023 compromised the personal data of nearly 15 million borrowers.

In most cases, this alternative 1.) shares the same strength (affordability, availability or borrower experience) as the lender reviewed; and 2.) rates highly for Bankrate Score. In the event more than one lender meets these standards, we suggest the one with the lowest APRs.

Eligibility Criteria:
- Compare lenders to find the lowest possible rate. But you should also consider borrowing limits, fees, eligibility requirements and funding speed.
- Apply for preapproval to see what terms and rates you are eligible for before committing. Some lenders will let you pre-qualify without hurting your credit.
- Business credit cards allow you to borrow what you need when you need it up to a credit limit. Credit cards also may come with perks like rewards programs, sign-up bonuses and an introductory period with 0 percent APR.
- Personal loans are generally easier to qualify for but may have higher rates and shorter repayment terms. And while many can be used for business expenses, not all lenders allow it — so check the fine print before you apply.

Application Process:
- Business grants are awarded to certain types of businesses, like those owned by minorities, veterans and women. You don’t have to pay back what you receive, but grants are extremely competitive and involve a lengthy application process.
- Home equity loans can be used for business expenses, but this should be a last resort. If you have a lot of equity in your home, this option could give you quick access to the cash you need. However, using a home equity loan puts you at risk of losing your home if you are unable to pay it back.

Financial Tips:
- To find the cost of a loan that uses factor rates, multiply the factor rate by the principal to determine how much you pay back.
- For example, if you have a factor rate of 1.30 on a loan of $10,000, your business will pay back $13,000 — the original $10,000 and $3,000 in loan costs. This doesn't include any additional fees the lender might tack on, like origination fees.
- Loans with factor rates tend to cost more and have shorter repayment periods. Before accepting one of these loans, convert the factor rate to an interest rate. This will make it easier to compare with other loan rates. You should also use a business loan calculator to see how much you could save if you had a loan with a comparable interest rate.
- Business loans are offered by banks (both traditional and online), credit unions and online lenders — although the amounts and repayment period vary widely among options.
- Bank loans are generally best suited for business owners with an established banking relationship. Online lenders, such as financial services companies, tend to be a better option for newer businesses and those with poor credit. Because of the variety of online lenders, more lending options and flexible repayment terms exist.
- Types of business loans
- There are countless options out there, but these are the most common types of business loans.
- Installment loan: Installment loans — also known as term loans — allow your business to borrow a lump sum and pay it back in monthly payments. These are some of the most common options, and you can find them offered by both banks and online lenders.
- Line of credit: A business line of credit functions like a credit card. You can draw funds from it as needed and only pay interest on what you borrow. As you pay back what you’ve borrowed, your credit limit resets and you can borrow more as needed.
- Commercial real estate loan: If your business is ready to open a brick-and-mortar location, a commercial real estate loan gives you the funding to buy property or sign a lease.
- Equipment loan: Equipment loans are term loans secured by the equipment your business needs to buy. Because the equipment acts as collateral, they tend to have lower rates than unsecured installment loans.
- SBA loan: The Small Business Administration (SBA) backs loans for businesses. While it doesn’t offer loans itself, it can help your business qualify for lower rates and better repayment terms. The SBA backs term loans, commercial real estate loans and other ways to borrow to expand your business.
- What to consider when shopping for a business loan
- Before taking out a loan, consider your business needs and the total cost of borrowing.
- Assess your business’s overall financial picture to give you a better idea of what you may be able to qualify for — and what type of loan would best suit your needs.

Application Process:
- Your age, driving history, credit tier and location can impact your rates, so it’s important to compare your rates to your demographic.
- Coverage.com, LLC is a licensed insurance producer (NPN: 19966249). Coverage.com services are only available in states where it is licensed. Coverage.com may not offer insurance coverage in all states or scenarios. All insurance products are governed by the terms in the applicable insurance policy, and all related decisions (such as approval for coverage, premiums, commissions and fees) and policy obligations are the sole responsibility of the underwriting insurer. The information on this site does not modify any insurance policy terms in any way.
- Speeding tickets are relatively common, but most carriers still see them as an indication of high-risk driver behavior. As such, a speeding ticket on your motor vehicle record causes your average annual payment to be 22 percent more per year. On top of the increased insurance costs, you may need to pay fines and even license and/or vehicle registration reinstatement fees, depending on the severity of your infraction.
- DUIs are among the most serious offenses that a driver can commit, and drivers with a DUI conviction pay an average of 93 percent more for coverage compared to drivers with clean records. Depending on your state’s regulations, you may also face a suspended license and registration, numerous fines and other financial and legal penalties. A DUI conviction can stay on your driving record for life in some states. Finding car insurance with a DUI on your MVR may be much more difficult than it is with a clean driving record, as not all insurance companies will agree to insure such risky drivers. If you have a DUI conviction on your record, it may be worth looking into a carrier that specializes in writing policies for high-risk drivers.
- Compare car insurance rates by credit tier
- In most states, your credit tier will affect your car insurance premium. Generally, drivers with lower credit-based insurance scores tend to file more claims and are thus viewed as a higher risk by carriers. California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan ban or restrict the use of credit as an auto insurance rating factor.

- Comparing carriers can get complicated, so Bankrate’s insurance editorial team compiled some basic tips to help you prepare for a smooth shopping experience. Gathering your info and deciding on your priorities before starting the quote process can make it easier to identify the offer that makes the most sense for you.
- Most states (except for New Hampshire) require that drivers purchase a car insurance policy in order to register their vehicles. While exact state minimum requirements vary on a state-by-state basis, they all include some form of bodily injury and property damage liability. In no-fault states, you may also need to purchase personal injury protection, uninsured motorist coverage and medical payments coverage. Getting familiar with the coverage requirements in your state can help you better understand how your policy works to protect your finances; plus, it can help you spot any potential coverage gaps.
- Keep in mind that if the insurance company did not check the driving records of all drivers listed on the policy, the quote can change once you purchase the policy. During the underwriting process, more information may be required before a policy can be issued, such as proof of address or prior insurance. The insurance company will inform you if additional information is needed, along with how to provide it and an approval timeframe.
- The best car insurance companies offer rates, coverage options, discounts, third-party scores and digital tools that fit your individual needs.
- Gauging customer satisfaction for insurance companies can be difficult, but third-party ratings and customer reviews paint a picture that may guide your search. If you’re looking for a quick snapshot of how well a given insurer meets customer needs, you may want to start with Bankrate’s insurance company reviews. For a sense of an insurer’s financial strength, you may want to look at AM Best ratings, which capture a company’s ability to reliably pay out on claims. Another measure of claims satisfaction comes from J.D. Power, which regularly reviews policyholders to understand their overall satisfaction with insurers’ customer service and claims handling. Finally, seeking out reviews from real customers on forums like Reddit or TrustPilot may offer some insight into the major strengths and pain points experienced by current policyholders.

Financial Tips:
- Reddit hosts a wide range of forums dedicated to topics related to auto insurance, from r/Car_Insurance_Help and r/Insurance to more general subreddits like r/personalfinance. While you may find some valuable advice here, including insights from users who identify themselves as industry insiders, you’ll also run up against users with a poor understanding of the insurance industry, including some who post strong opinions out of frustration.
- Comparing car insurance rates from multiple providers is not the only way to save on car insurance. Before you begin shopping around for new quotes, it may be helpful to first inquire about discounts offered by your current insurance provider. Similarly, taking stock of your coverage needs and eliminating unnecessary add-ons may also help to lower your rates. In addition, maintaining a clean driving record and working on your credit score (in relevant states) may help keep your rates low over time.

- In the U.S., the average annual cost of car insurance is $2,678 per year for full coverage and $799 per year for minimum coverage. For the past several years, Bankrate has closely monitored auto insurance rates. Unsurprisingly, premiums are trending upward with no signs of dipping back down. However, your rate may differ since individual factors like your age, gender, driving history, vehicle and more affect the price of your car insurance policy. If your car insurance rate increased at renewal, you may be able to save by shopping around, evaluating your coverage types and levels, and improving your credit score.

- For credit-based insurance score rates:
- Rates were calculated based on the following insurance credit tiers assigned to our drivers: “poor, average, good (base) and excellent.” Insurance credit tiers factor in your official credit scores but are not dependent on that variable alone. Four states prohibit or limit the use of credit as a rating factor in determining auto insurance rates: California, Hawaii, Massachusetts and Michigan.

- To determine minimum coverage limits, Bankrate used minimum coverage that meets each state’s requirements. These are sample rates and should only be used for comparative purposes. Your quotes will differ.

Financial Tips:
- Here’s what to think about when you’re searching for a financial advisor to work with and some tips for choosing the right advisor for you.
- A financial advisor can help with various aspects of your financial life, ranging from budgeting and saving for retirement to managing an investment portfolio or estate planning. Many of these issues can be complex and intimidating. Financial advisors spend their time working with these issues and are there to guide you through your own financial journey.
- If you’re looking for an advisor who can provide real value to you, it’s important to research a number of potential options and not simply pick the first name that advertises to you. Here are some tips to help you choose a trustworthy financial advisor that you can rely on.
- Before you choose an advisor, you’ll want to spend some time thinking about why you’re looking for a financial advisor in the first place. Some people are primarily looking for investment advice or help saving for retirement, while others are looking for advice on how to pay off debt or develop an overall financial plan.
- “These individuals have mastered a complex body of knowledge, have passed a comprehensive examination (or in the case of a CFA charterholder, a series of examinations), and agree to abide by a code of ethics,” says Robert Johnson, professor of finance at Creighton University.
- There are thousands of financial advisors across the U.S., so it can be intimidating to try to find the right one for you. Here are some tips to help you research and find financial advisors in your area.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/loans/personal-loans/what-is-a-personal-loan

Eligibility Criteria:
- Not considering your credit score: Your credit score is a big factor in determining your eligibility for the loan as well as the interest rate. Some lenders may also charge higher origination fees for less creditworthy borrowers. Before applying, know what your score is so that you know what to expect in terms of costs.
- Not reading the fine print: Before you sign and finalize the loan agreements, review the terms to make sure they’re what you agreed to.
- Falling behind on payments. Make loan payments on time to avoid defaulting on your personal loan and causing a negative hit to your credit.

Application Process:
- The loan application process can take anywhere from a few hours to several days. Once you’re approved, the lender will disburse your loan funds into your bank account.
- The loan repayment process tends to begin within 30 days following approval. Lenders generally report account activity to the credit bureau, so making timely payments can help you boost your credit score.
- Common uses of personal loans
- Personal loan proceeds can be used for almost any legal purpose. Some lenders may restrict you to only unsecured options, while others may allow you to secure a personal loan with an asset, like a car or boat. Overall, personal loan funds give you the cash to use for a variety of different purposes.
- Debt consolidation: Debt consolidation loans may help you save money on interest by combining high-interest credit card or other debt into a single personal loan.
- Paying for emergency expenses: Same- or next-day funding times make emergency personal loans a great option for financial emergencies, such as surprise medical bills, a leaky roof or even funeral expenses.
- Home improvement projects: Unsecured personal loans are approved faster than home equity products and don’t require putting your home up for collateral. Using a personal loan to increase the value of your home is a way to use a personal loan to make money.
- Financing life’s big events: Major life milestones like financing a wedding or dream vacation often come with high price tags. A personal loan is also a good alternative to using credit cards because of their generally lower cost. But remember that you may be paying off the bill for years to come.
- Investing in yourself: A personal loan may be a good tool to increase your value as an employee. You might pursue a workplace certification or attend a career-boosting seminar. However, lenders may not allow you to use personal loan funds to pay for college tuition.
- Refinancing an existing loan: If you took out a bad credit loan and your scores have improved, you can look into refinancing an existing loan for a lower rate or monthly payment.
- If you’re tired of seeing your credit card balances barely budge when making minimum payments, a personal loan can help you reduce your balances much faster. Just make sure your budget is ready for a fixed monthly payment and you have consistent income to make the payments. Your credit scores may improve quickly after paying off revolving credit balances — as long as you don’t turn around and start using credit cards again.
- — Denny Ceizyk, Bankrate senior loans writer
- Common features of personal loans
- Most personal loans have similar features, regardless of the lender.
- Fixed interest rates: Personal loan lenders charge fixed interest rates based primarily on your creditworthiness and debt-to-income ratio. Because interest rates are fixed, the APR on a personal loan won’t change over time.
- Stable monthly payments: A fixed rate gives you a predictable monthly payment, making personal loans a popular choice for consolidating debt.
- Long loan terms: Most lenders offer repayment terms of one to seven years. This makes it easy to calculate your payment and see how much interest you will pay over time.
- Origination fees: You may pay an origination fee of up to 12 percent for a personal loan. The fee is deducted from your funds when you finalize your application, reducing the amount you receive from the lender.
- How personal loan rates are determined
- Lenders’ minimum and maximum annual percentage rates (APRs) are influenced by the federal funds rate, among other factors. These rates change based on the market, but once you receive a rate, it is fixed for the loan’s term.
- Your interest rate is based primarily on your credit score. If you have an excellent score, you may qualify for a lender’s lowest rates. The best rates typically go to people with credit scores above 800.
- Income: Lenders like to see that you have a steady and reliable income source, like a salary or full-time hourly job, to prove you can make your monthly payments.
- Payment history: Lenders typically reward you with a lower interest rate if you’ve managed your credit without late payments.
- Debt-to-income ratio: If a high percentage of your income is already used to pay debts, lenders may charge you a higher rate to cover the risk you might not be able to afford a new personal loan.
- Loan term: You may be offered a lower APR for a shorter term or charge a higher rate for longer terms. The lender knows the longer you have a loan, the more likely something could change in your finances that could make the payment unaffordable.
- Personal loan mistakes to avoid
- Knowing the six common mistakes people make when taking out a personal loan can help you avoid them.
- Getting a longer loan term than necessary: The longer the loan term, the more interest you’ll have to pay during the life of your loan. Before taking on debt, use a personal loan repayment calculator to help budget.

- How to compare personal loans
- Best personal loan rates

Financial Tips:
- Not shopping around for the best offers: Gathering quotes from multiple lenders can help you spot the best deal and potentially save you interest. Compare interest rates, fees and lender reputation before applying for the loan.
- One other mistake to avoid is committing to a personal loan if your income is unstable. If you earn the bulk of your income from variable income like commissions or tips, a fixed payment may be tough to handle if you have a low earnings month. Also, don’t choose a short term unless you’re sure you can make the payments. For example, if you depend on a spouse’s income to cover half your expenses, a short-term personal loan payment could become a burden if your spouse is laid off.
- — Denny Ceizyk, Bankrate senior loans writer
- If you need to borrow money and prefer the stability of a fixed monthly payment, a personal loan could be exactly what you need. To get the best loan rates and terms, improve your credit and pay down existing debt to get the most competitive loan rates and terms. It’s also important to shop around and compare personal loan rates with multiple lenders in the personal loan space, including companies that offer online loans.
- Is a personal loan the best way to borrow money?
- Personal loans are great for short- to medium-term borrowing at rates that are typically lower than credit cards. They can be a good option if you have good credit and a specific financial goal in mind.

- Can anyone get a personal loan?
- No. Personal loans require documented proof you have the credit profile and income to repay them. Although they’re easier to qualify for than home equity loans or other secured loans, you still need to show the lender you have the means to pay the loan back.

- Are personal loans better than credit cards?
- Personal loans are better than credit cards if you want a set monthly payment and need all of your funds at once. They also feature fixed rates, so you don’t have to worry about your payment changing like they do with most variable-rate credit cards.Credit cards may be a better personal loan alternative if you need the flexibility to draw money as needed, pay it off and re-use it. Credit cards may also offer rewards or cash-back options that personal loans don’t.

Application Process:
- Use Bankrate’s CD calculator to determine what you will earn before you decide to open a CD.
- Let’s say, for example, that you deposit $20,000 in a 3-year CD that pays a 3.10 percent APY. You would earn $1,918.26. To get a good idea of how much you may be able to earn from a CD investment, use Bankrate’s CD calculator.
- While a ladder has multiple steps with even space between them, a barbell skips all those middle rungs in favor of short-term and  long-term CD investments. For example, a barbell might look like this:
- CDs come with a guaranteed, or fixed, rate of return — meaning the rate you get when you open a CD stays the same until its maturity. What’s more, the money you earn from interest, plus the principal balance, are protected by federal insurance, as long as the issuing bank or credit union is part of the FDIC or NCUA, respectively. Federal insurance covers up to $250,000 per FDIC bank or NCUA credit union, per depositor and per ownership category.
- Opening a CD is a simple process, but there are some stumbling blocks that can get in your way. Avoid these errors to make sure you’re maximizing your earnings and minimizing your chances of penalties.
- Choosing the first CD you see: Many banks and credit unions offer CDs, and these offerings come at varying terms and yields. You can use Bankrate’s best CDs list to compare some options.

Financial Tips:
- Many CD investors opt for a more in-depth strategy than simply choosing one CD for their funds. Because CDs are available in a range of terms (or maturities), you can consider purchasing multiple CDs with different term lengths – some shorter, some longer – to maximize your earnings while freeing up some of the funds sooner for reinvestment. Here are three such strategies:
- CD rates are competitive in this current rate environment, which makes it all the more important to shop around and find the best rates for the terms you’re seeking. Additionally, you might consider an investment strategy that takes advantage of multiple CDs at different term lengths. Just be aware of penalties for taking money out of the CD earlier than its maturity date.

Application Process:
- But what exactly is the process for filing your taxes? There are a few options.
- Using these tools is easy. They guide the process by asking you simple questions and filling out your state and federal returns for you. You can even take pictures of your tax forms and upload them to have your info entered automatically. (Here are Bankrate’s top picks for best tax software.)
- I’ve never met anyone who’s still doing their taxes manually, especially when it’s their first time. You’d have to fill out Form 1040 by hand and use a calculator to add up all your income and deductions. Then you’d have to mail the form and wait at least four weeks for the IRS to process your return. Here’s more on how long it takes to get your tax refund.
- This is your best option because this way you’ll avoid any fees. Plus, the IRS will have your account information on file for refunds. People who pay directly from their bank account can count on the quickest process — and the fastest refund if they’re owed one.
- You can also pay your taxes with a debit or credit card, but keep in mind that there will be fees involved.
- If you ask me, it doesn’t really make sense to pay with your debit card — just use your bank account instead to avoid the processing fee and get all the benefits that come with the direct deposit.
- As for whether it’s a good idea to pay with a credit card, it depends. There’s also a fee, but if you’re working toward earning your sign-up bonus, it may be worth it.
- I know some hardcore credit card enthusiasts who once overpaid their taxes to get a bonus, knowing the IRS would refund them. Do the math to see if that makes sense in your case and make sure you can pay off the debt right away to avoid losing money to your card’s interest (unless you have a 0 percent APR credit card).
- Apply for a payment plan
- Thankfully, the IRS offers various payment plan options. Like with any kind of debt, there’s interest to pay on top of penalties. But in a pinch, a payment plan can be very helpful. Here are your options if you can’t pay the IRS.
- Taxes are never fun. Still, don’t let the process scare you, even if you’re filing for the first time. Use a reliable tax service or contact a tax professional if you could use some help — just make sure to check their credentials. You can do it, and welcome to the wonderland of adulthood.
- How student loans impact your taxes

Financial Tips:
- There’s nothing wrong with having a specialist do your taxes if your tax situation is a bit more complex. Of course, you’ll have to pay a fee, which varies by the tax preparer and complexity of your taxes. It can be a certified public accountant, attorney or enrolled agent — just make sure the person is qualified by checking their credentials. Here are five tips to find the best tax preparer for you.
- If you’re looking for an affordable option, look into your local credit unions which may offer low-cost tax preparation services.
- If you’re still a student, you may be able to get free help on campus. The IRS has a database of Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) sites that you may be able to use, and many are located on college campuses.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/401-k-calculator


Application Process:
- At Bankrate, we aim to provide reliable personal finance information. We value your feedback.
- Annual salary: This is your annual salary from your employer before taxes and other benefit deductions. Since your contribution and company match are based on the salary paid to you by your employer, do not include any income you may receive from sources other than your employer.
- It is important to note that some employees are subject to another form of contribution limitations. Employees classified as "Highly Compensated" may be subject to contribution limits based on their employer's overall 401(k) participation. If you expect your salary to be $150,000 or more in 2023, you may need to contact your employer to see if these additional contribution limits apply to you.
- Age of retirement: Age you wish to retire. This calculator assumes that the year you retire, you do not make any contributions to your 401(k). So if you retire at age 65, your last contribution occurs when you are actually 64.
- Annual rate of return: The annual rate of return for your 401(k) account. This calculator assumes that your return is compounded annually and your deposits are made monthly. The actual rate of return is largely dependent on the types of investments you select. The Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) has returned about 10 percent over the long term, but returns can be quite volatile over short time periods. Fixed-income investments such as bonds are typically less volatile, but generally offer lower returns compared to stocks.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-buy-a-vacation-home


Application Process:
- Before you decide to take out a mortgage on a vacation home, make sure the costs you might face are within your budget.
- In addition to your monthly mortgage payment, you’ll pay other expenses, such as:
- If you’re planning to get a loan for a vacation home, your mortgage lender will require homeowners insurance. Premiums vary depending on the property’s type and location. For example, a beachside home can be riskier due to the potential for hurricanes and flooding, so you’ll likely pay more than you would to insure an inland home.
- Step 4: Work with a local mortgage lender and a local Realtor
- Buying real estate in a new area — or even one you’ve vacationed in for many years — requires expert guidance. Consider working with an experienced local lender who specializes in loans for vacation homes and a local real estate professional. Local lenders and Realtors will understand the required rules and specifics for the area where you’re buying, which can be especially helpful if you plan to rent out the property.
- Step 5: Decide how to finance your vacation home
- Conventional loan: A conventional loan for a vacation home is typically a fixed-rate mortgage, which locks in a mortgage rate for a specific term of up to 30 years.
- Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): You can also get an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) on vacation homes. This type of mortgage locks in your interest rate for a set initial period, usually between five and 10 years. After that, it changes to the current market rate.
- Home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC): If you have equity in your current property, you may have the option of financing your vacation home with either a home equity loan or a HELOC. This uses your ownership stake as collateral for your loan or line of credit. You could also opt for a cash-out refinance, which turns your existing mortgage into a new, larger mortgage and lets you pocket the difference in cash.
- VA loans and FHA mortgages are not available for vacation homes.
- Step 6: Compare vacation home mortgage rates
- Vacation home mortgage rates are typically higher than financing for a primary residence by about 0.5 to 1 percent. Be sure to search for the best second home mortgage rates and terms.
- Vacation home loan requirements
- Before you can be approved for a mortgage on a vacation home, you and the home must meet a few requirements.
- As a borrower, these requirements include:
- Debt-to-income ratio: Borrowers can sometimes finance a primary residence with a 50 percent debt-to-income ratio (DTI). For a vacation property, DTI can be up to 45 percent. Projected rental income cannot be used to qualify if you plan to use the property as a second home, but you may be able to use it if you intend the property to be a rental.
- Credit score: Lenders tend to look for a higher credit score when financing vacation home properties. You will likely need a credit score of at least 660 for a vacation home loan, compared to the 620 typically required for primary residence mortgages.
- Reserves: In some cases, you can buy a primary residence with little or no reserves. For a vacation home, you’ll likely need reserves equal to two to six monthly mortgage payments.
- To get a loan for a vacation home, the property must meet the following requirements, according to Freddie Mac:
- The borrower must occupy it for some portion of the year.
- The borrower must have exclusive control over the property.
- Other ways to finance a vacation home
- There may be other ways, aside from getting a mortgage, to finance the vacation home you’ve been eyeing.
- A vacation home can be a valuable asset that allows you to build wealth over time and can even provide a passive stream of income. However, first, you must ensure that your budget can comfortably afford the mortgage payment and the additional upkeep expenses. Read up on other important considerations before buying a second home to inform your decision.

Read up on other important considerations before buying a second home to inform your decision.
- How much does a vacation home mortgage cost?
- A vacation home mortgage will cover the cost of the home’s purchase price — minus your down payment — plus interest. You’ll also have to pay for property taxes and insurance, as well as possible homeowner’s association and related fees.
- How much does a vacation home mortgage cost?
- Can I use rental income to pay my second home mortgage?
- While you may or may not be able to use projected income to qualify for a mortgage on your second home, you can use it to pay your mortgage. The IRS doesn’t preclude second homes from being rented out and earning income — and if you do choose to rent out your second home, you can use that income to offset your mortgage.

- Current 10-year mortgage interest rates
- As of Saturday, March 15, 2025, current 10-year mortgage rates are 5.85.
- Ten-year mortgage rates follow prevailing interest rates, which rose steadily from 2022 to peak in the fall of 2023. Nearing the start of 2024, rates fell, dropping to 6.03 percent on New Year’s Eve. Since then, rates have fluctuated, staying between 6.1 percent and 6.7 percent.
- The table below brings together a comprehensive national survey of mortgage lenders to help you know what are the most competitive mortgage interest rates. This table is updated daily to give you the most current interest rates and APRs when choosing a mortgage home loan.
- 10-year mortgage vs. other loan terms
- Generally, the shorter the loan term, the lower the interest rate. With 15- and 30-year mortgages, you’ll usually be charged a higher interest rate than you’d pay with a 10-year. Because of the longer loan term, you’ll be paying it for longer, too. Bottom line: You’ll pay more in interest overall the more years you’re repaying the loan.
- The below examples show the monthly payments, total interest and total cost on a $380,000 purchase mortgage across different loan terms:

- 10-year mortgage FAQ
- What is a 10-year mortgage?
- A 10-year mortgage amortizes over 10 years. This means you’ll repay it in installments, with interest, over a decade. For the borrower who wants to pay off their mortgage quickly while reducing how much total interest they pay, a 10-year mortgage offers a way to do just that. To find out if a 10-year mortgage is right for you, do the math using our mortgage calculator.

- What are the alternatives to a 10-year mortgage?
- Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM): An ARM and a 10-year loan typically have lower interest rates. However, the ARM rate is variable, so it’ll change after the initial lower-rate period ends. If you plan on moving within this introductory rate window, it might make sense to take out an ARM, which amortizes over 30 years, rather than a 10-year loan.
- 30-year or 15-year fixed-rate mortgages: Like a 10-year mortgage, 15-year and 30-year fixed-rate mortgages offer a predictable payment over the loan term. While their longer loan terms mean your monthly payment will be lower, you’ll pay more in interest than you would with a 10-year loan.
- Extra payments: If you can’t manage the higher payments on a 10-year loan, you can still pay off your loan in less time by making additional payments. You might do this by paying a little extra each month, biweekly or a lump sum once a year.
- Refinance: If you’re starting off with a longer-term mortgage, you might be able to refinance to a shorter term with a lower rate down the line.

- How is my interest rate for a 10-year mortgage determined?
- The rate you get on a 10-year mortgage depends primarily on your credit score. Lenders also look at the size of your down payment and other assets, your income and debt. More broadly, mortgage rates move with the overall economy. While the Federal Reserve doesn’t directly control mortgage rates, its policy does guide the interest rate environment.Sometimes, the rates for 10-year mortgages can be higher than those for 15-year mortgages, even though the shorter term of a 10-year loan presents less risk. That’s because 10-year mortgages are a niche product compared to 15-year loans.

Application Process:
- Calculating equity starts with identifying the property’s market value. You can find out how much your home is worth using a number of methods. Online home price estimators are an easy (and free) way to gauge your home’s worth. These popular online tools rely on algorithms and publicly available information to generate estimates. Keep in mind, though, that the results really are estimates, not necessarily the value amount a lender will assess if you decide to apply for financing.
- The next number you’ll need is the outstanding balance on your mortgage, which can be found on your most recent statement. You could also check your lender or servicer’s online dashboard, assuming it has one, or call directly for this information.
- Once you have your home’s value and your mortgage balance, you’re almost finished. From here, all you need to figure out how to calculate equity is some simple subtraction.  Your home equity equals the current value of your home minus your current mortgage debt.
- Assume your home’s current value is $410,000, and you have a $220,000 balance remaining on your mortgage. Subtract the $220,000 outstanding balance from the $410,000 value. Your calculation would look like this:
- Using our example above, that’s 0.8 x $410,000, or $328,000. Subtract $220,000 (what you still owe on your mortgage), and you’d have $108,000 of tappable equity.
- Keep in mind: Home equity loans don’t come for free. These loans come with some closing costs, similar to taking out a traditional mortgage. These costs can include fees for loan origination, an appraisal, a credit report and title searches.
- Specifically, the lender will also look at your LTV ratio, or the size of your loan divided by your home’s value, expressed as a percentage. You can do the math with Bankrate’s LTV calculator. Or, use this equation (we’ll employ the same numbers from our example above):
- So far, so good. Unfortunately, with home equity-backed loans or lines of credit, it doesn’t stop there. For this sort of financing, lenders look not just at the LTV, but something called the combined LTV (CLTV) ratio. The CLTV includes your first mortgage and any other loans attached to your home — including the HELOC or home equity loan you’re applying for.
- For example, if you wanted a $30,000 home equity loan, your CLTV would come to 60.97 percent:
- The higher the LTV ratio, the more risk for the lender. And the higher an interest rate they’re likely to charge you.
- In other words, knowing how to determine equity in a home isn’t enough to determine how much money you can borrow. You also want to look at the CLTV you’d have, from your original mortgage plus the new loan.
- Once you know how to calculate home equity and how much you can borrow, you’ll need to choose between loan types. The options include:
- Home equity loans: A home equity loan allows you to borrow a lump sum of money upfront and repay it in equal installments at a fixed interest rate. It could be ideal if you know how much you need and prefer a predictable monthly payment and stable interest rate.

Financial Tips:
- Your LTV or loan-to-value ratio is the size of your mortgage vis-à-vis your home’s worth. Expressed as a percentage, it’s computed by dividing the principal balance of your mortgage by your home’s appraised value and multiplying the result by 100.  Lenders consider it when approving you for a mortgage or other home-based financing, including home equity loans, HELOCs and other vehicles that let you tap your home for cash.
- Lenders calculate your CLTV or combined loan-to-value ratio when you apply for a second mortgage. It represents the total debt against the home: both the original mortgage and the size of the new home equity loan or line of credit.
- Calculating home equity is relatively simple math, and if you have accurate figures on hand, all you have to do is plug them into a home equity calculator. You can determine your level of equity on your own, as well. Here’s how.
- Home equity lines of credit: A HELOC is more flexible and allows you to fund multiple projects over time. Once approved, you can borrow up to a set limit during the draw period, which usually lasts 10 years. As with a credit card, you borrow only what you need when you need it. The difference is, you only pay variable interest during the draw window. Once the draw period ends, you repay what you borrowed and any outstanding interest. Basically, your line of credit converts to a loan that’s repayable over a set period, usually up to 20 years.
- Cash-out refinancing: With a cash-out refinance, you replace your existing mortgage with a new, larger mortgage. The difference between the two balances will be given to you in a lump-sum payment that you can use for any purpose. In terms of interest rate, a cash-out refinance is usually less expensive compared to other products that provide faster cash, like personal loans and credit cards. It also tends to run a few percentage points lower than HELoans and HELOCs. That said, it could also mean trading a lower mortgage rate on your existing loan for a higher one on the new loan, costing you far more over time.
- Home equity loans and private mortgage insurance (PMI)
- What if you’re paying private mortgage insurance (PMI) on your original mortgage? In most instances, a home equity loan won’t impact your PMI premiums. But it could affect your timetable for getting rid of them.
- PMI is imposed on conventional mortgages when the homebuyer puts less than 20 percent down (meaning the LTV ratio on their loan is over 80 percent). Normally, you can request cancellation of PMI when you’ve built up a 20 percent equity stake, and your LTV is down to 80 percent. And by law your lender must cancel it when your LTV reaches 78 percent.
- Now, home equity loans and HELOCs don’t directly affect your LTV — it’s calculated just on your primary mortgage — and your new bigger CLTV doesn’t count towards extending the premiums. However, the extra debt could make your mortgage lender a little nervous. It could deny your request to cancel your PMI when you hit that 80 percent LTV threshold, and can insist that you wait until the LTV drops two additional percentage points.
- You can control one piece of the home equity calculation: your mortgage balance. As you make monthly payments, that balance goes down and your equity goes up.
- Let’s go back to our example above. Say you paid $410,000 for your house when you bought it, but its fair market value has since increased to $440,000. That’s an additional $30,000 in your home equity stake. Home-value increases accrue to your side of the ledger, not your lender’s, because your mortgage balance is set when you close on your home. It’ll go down as you make payments, of course, but the size of the debt doesn’t fluctuate with changes in property values.
- Many home equity lenders require you to have at least 20 percent equity before being eligible for a HELOC or home equity loan. How long it will take to reach that minimum will depend on how much money you put down upfront in your down payment, how home values are appreciating in your market and whether you’re completing value-adding renovations.
- Should I have my home professionally appraised before applying for a HELOC?
- You can apply for a HELOC without getting an appraisal. Once your lender receives your application, it will order its own appraisal to determine your home’s value. Be advised, though, that you’ll probably need to pay for that appraiser’s services.
- Should I have my home professionally appraised before applying for a HELOC?
- As you follow your repayment schedule and pay down your mortgage, you’re building equity in your home. If you make extra mortgage payments, or complete upgrades that increase the value of your house you can boost your equity level sooner. Another way to preserve your equity: Keep up with home maintenance and repairs. A home’s condition affects its market value.

====================================================================================================

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/home-equity-loan-vs-line-of-credit

Eligibility Criteria:
- Each lender has its own eligibility criteria for home equity loans and HELOCs. However, here are some general guidelines to keep in mind:
- Credit score: A credit score of 640 could be enough with some lenders, but aim for 700 or higher to have the best approval odds (and get the best interest rates).
- Income: Your income should be consistent and verifiable.
- Debt-to-income (ratio): You’ll need an acceptable DTI to qualify for funding, arouond 43 percent.
- Obtaining a home equity loan or line of credit
- How to obtain a home equity loan
- Home equity loans are available through banks, credit unions and online lenders. Some offer online prequalification tools that let you view loan offers with estimated monthly payments and terms without impacting your credit score.

Application Process:
- If you decide to formally apply, you can typically start the process online and upload the requested documentation to get a lending decision. You can also visit a branch if you’re doing business with a traditional bank or credit union. Either way, formally applying for a home equity loan will result in a hard pull that impacts your credit score.
- Note: Home equity loans come with a three-day cancelation rule, aka the right of rescission. It allows you to back out of the contract without penalty within three business days.
- The process for obtaining a home equity loan and HELOC are similar, as are the qualifications. However, HELOCs may be harder to get in some cases, with more stringent criteria. For example, peer-to-peer lender Prosper sets a 660 credit score minimum for HELOCs, vs. 640 for home equity loans.
- Am I able to get a home equity loan or HELOC with bad credit?
- Even if you have less than ideal credit, it’s still possible to obtain a home equity loan or HELOC. It’s not likely that you’ll get the most competitive interest rate, but if you have reliable income and a relationship with a lender, you could qualify for a loan.
- There are also lenders that will approve home equity loans and HELOCs for borrowers who have FICO scores as low as 620, provided that you meet other requirements related to debt levels, equity and income.
- In addition to a credit score of at least 620, in order to earn approval, you’ll likely need about 15 percent to 20 percent equity in your home and a maximum debt-to-income (DTI) ratio of 43 percent, or up to 50 percent depending on the lender. Lenders also like to see an on-time mortgage payment history.
- Choosing between HELOC and home equity loan: Which is right for you?
- How to decide between a home equity loan and a HELOC? Ask yourself these questions.
- A home equity loan could be a good fit if you know what you’ll use the funds for, when you’ll need them and exactly how much you’ll need. However, a HELOC could work better if you don’t know exactly the total expense you’ll incur, and/or you’ll need to keep a ready source of funds on hand. Or, if your costs will extend over a long period of time (like paying a home contractor in installments, or college tuition for four years).
- Do you prefer predictability in your obligations? A home equity loan is ideal if you like a fixed interest rate and monthly payment that won’t ever change. And you’re not an interest-rate watcher.
- HELOCs can be a slippery slope to more debt than you can handle if you only repay the interest during the draw period and none of the principal. Taking this approach can cause sticker shock when the HELOC repayment phase begins and you have a substantial debt left to repay. Unless you expect to come into a significant sum of money or windfall in the future, it’s a good idea to pay both principal and interest during the draw period on a HELOC, and not give in to the temptation of minimal, interest-only payments.
- If that’s not you, a home equity loan might be a better choice, as it imposes a repayment schedule on you, similar to your mortgage. It helps to prevent the debt from becoming unmanageable.
- Bottom line on home equity loans and HELOCs
- Home equity loans and HELOCs both allow you to borrow money against your home equity, but they’re not the same. Consider the purpose of the funds, how much you need and whether or not you’ll want to borrow more in the future.
- For example, if you want an upfront lump sum and a predictable repayment schedule and sums, then a home equity loan might be the right choice. The trade-off is that you’ll need to know exactly how much you want to borrow; otherwise, you could end up with more or less than you need. But if you do, say to settle a bunch of credit card bills, then the loan could be ideal.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/loans/personal-loans/unsecured-loans-definition

Eligibility Criteria:
- When determining eligibility for an unsecured loan, lenders will consider factors such as credit history, income and debt-to-income ratio.
- Unsecured loans are offered by banks, credit unions and online lenders. Unlike secured loans, they’re not backed by collateral and may be harder to get approved for than a secured option. However, they come with less risk as you won’t need to worry about your assets being seized should you fail to make the payments.
- Most installment loans are unsecured. This includes student loans, personal loans and revolving credit such as credit cards. Eligibility will vary from lender to lender, but you’ll generally need good or excellent credit and a steady source of income to qualify.
- The most creditworthy borrowers are more likely to be offered the best loan terms and lowest interest rates. You can generally use an unsecured loan for nearly every legal expense.
- What is an unsecured loan?
- Unsecured loans are loans that don’t require collateral. They’re also referred to as signature loans because a signature is all that’s needed if you meet the lender’s borrowing requirements. Because lenders take on more risk when loans aren’t backed by collateral, they often charge higher interest rates and require good or excellent credit to get approved.
- Unsecured loans are available as revolving debt — a credit card — or an installment loan, like a personal or student loan. Installment loans require you to pay back the total balance in fixed, monthly installments over a set period.
- Credit cards allow you to use what you need when you need it. They often have higher interest rates than loans. If you miss a monthly payment, you’ll be charged interest on top of the principal amount.
- Who should get an unsecured loan?
- Borrowers who need money but aren’t comfortable pledging collateral to secure a loan can consider an unsecured loan when:
- Planning for a large purchase. Taking on debt can strain your finances, but if you need funds for a big upcoming expense, an unsecured loan can help.
- They have good credit. A high credit score unlocks more favorable unsecured loan terms and interest rates.
- They have reliable income. Although collateral isn’t needed for an unsecured loan, you’ll need steady income to repay the debt and avoid defaulting on the loan. Unpaid secured loans can negatively affect your credit.
- Consolidating debt. Unsecured loans are useful as debt consolidation tools that can make debt repayment simpler. This strategy can also help borrowers save money if they qualify for lower interest rates.
- Types of unsecured loans
- There are several types of unsecured loans to choose from. However, the most popular options are personal loans, student loans and credit cards.
- Personal loans
- A personal loan can consolidate debt, finance a large purchase, expense an ongoing project or finance home renovations.
- There are personal loans available for nearly everything, including wedding loans, pet loans and holiday loans. Technically these are just unsecured personal loans (also called signature loans) in which the funds are to be exclusively used for related purchases. Personal loan interest rates are typically lower than credit card rates.
- Loan amount: Around $1,000 to $50,000
- Who a personal loan is best for: Good credit borrowers who know exactly how much funding they need.

- Loan amount: Around $1,000 to $50,000
- Who a personal loan is best for: Good credit borrowers who know exactly how much funding they need.
- Student loans
- There are two types of student loans: federal and private student loans. Federal loans are the better choice for most borrowers because they carry much lower rates and are available to every student attending a participating college. Private lenders offer private student loans and can come with higher rates and more stringent eligibility requirements. These loans are best used when filling funding gaps, as they don’t come with the benefits and protections that federal loans offer.
- Loan amount: Up to full cost of attendance (private loans only)
- Average interest rate: Up to 17 percent (private loans), up to 8.05 percent (federal loans)
- Repayment timeline: Anywhere from five to 20 years, but will vary for every borrower
- Who a student loan is best for: Upcoming and current post-secondary education students supplementing their need- or merit-based financial aid.

- Repayment timeline: Anywhere from five to 20 years, but will vary for every borrower
- Who a student loan is best for: Upcoming and current post-secondary education students supplementing their need- or merit-based financial aid.
- Credit cards
- Credit cards are one of the most common financing options. They’re a revolving debt, so the funds are available whenever needed. You can borrow up to your credit limit, which is assigned by the lender, and can borrow up to that limit. You can use a credit card to consolidate debt, for everyday spending, or to fund a larger purchase or experience. However, rates can be high and interest adds up fast if you carry a balance.
- Credit limit: Typically between $2,000 and $10,000
- Who a credit card is best for: Individuals with healthy spending habits looking for a long-term revolving line of credit.

- Who a credit card is best for: Individuals with healthy spending habits looking for a long-term revolving line of credit.
- Unsecured loans vs. secured loans: which is better?
- Secured loans differ from unsecured loans in that secured loans require collateral. The lender won’t approve a secured loan if a borrower doesn’t agree to provide an asset as insurance.
- Secured loans exist for financing options including:
- Mortgages.
- Car loans.
- Home equity lines of credit.
- Some types of personal loans.
- Borrowers will not encounter unsecured mortgages as the home is always used as collateral. Unsecured auto loans exist but are uncommon.
- Pros and cons of unsecured loans
- Unsecured loan options may be less risky than other loan types for certain borrowers, but not all. When taking out any long-term debt, making a fully educated decision is crucial to promoting financial health.
- Pros of unsecured loans
- Competitive rates for those with strong credit.
- Cons of unsecured loans
- Might have lower borrowing limits for those with low credit scores.
- Might have higher interest rates for those with low credit scores.
- Has fewer borrowing options than secured loans.
- Qualifications for an unsecured loan
- To limit their risk, lenders want to be reasonably sure you can repay the loan. Lenders measure that risk by checking a few factors, so they may ask about the following information when you apply for an unsecured loan (and tailor the loan terms according to your answers):
- Your credit
- Lenders check your credit reports to see how you’ve managed loans and credit cards in the past. Generally, they look for a history of responsible credit use (typically one or more years), on-time payments, low credit card balances and a mix of account types. They’ll also check your credit scores, which are calculated based on the information in your credit reports. Consumers with FICO credit scores around 700 or higher usually qualify for the best interest rates.
- Your income
- Knowing you have the means to meet your financial obligations, including the loan payments, lowers the lender’s risk. The lender may ask to see proof of stable, sufficient income, such as a current pay stub.
- Your debt-to-income ratio
- To calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI), add all your monthly debt payments and divide that total by your gross monthly income.
- For example, if you have $500 worth of existing debt payments and $2,000 in gross income each month, your DTI is $500 / $2,000 = 0.25 or 25 percent.
- Lenders use this number to measure your ability to repay a loan. The lower the ratio, the better. Every lender will have a different requirement for your DTI; however, credit.org asserts that the maximum is usually no higher than 36 percent.
- Although unsecured loans don’t require collateral, the lender may want to know you have savings. They know you’re less likely to miss loan payments when you’re prepared to cover financial emergencies.
- How to apply

Application Process:
- If an unsecured loan is right for you, applying takes several simple steps:
- Research top lenders. You can find unsecured loans through national and local banks, credit unions and online lenders.
- Compare unsecured loan offers. Some lenders offer prequalification so you can see which loans you might qualify for before you apply. Look at each lender’s interest rates, fees, loan terms and amounts and special features.
- Submit an application. Complete a formal loan application after checking preliminary offers and selecting your preferred lender. This can be done online or in person through most lenders.
- Provide documentation. If the lender asks for additional documentation, submit it in a timely manner. For example, this might come up if you don’t have strong credit.
- Accept loan funds. If approved, the lender will tell you how you’ll receive the loan funds. You’ll receive the money as a lump sum if it’s an installment loan. For revolving loans, such as a credit card, the lender will issue you a credit card to draw funds from the account as needed.
- The main advantage of an unsecured loan is that you don’t have to pledge collateral. But if you default on the loan, you could still face serious consequences, like major damage to your credit. Plus, a lender could take you to court to garnish your wages.
- Taking out an unsecured loan can be good if you plan to repay the debt. If you decide an unsecured loan is right, compare rates, terms, and fees from as many lenders as possible before applying.

- Funding U: Best for undergraduate borrowers
- Funding U: Best for undergraduate borrowers
- Overview: Funding U does not use credit scores to make lending decisions. Instead, it considers an individual borrower's academic achievements, career path and GPA alongside credit history — like late payments and collections items. This makes it a great option for borrowers without a credit history or a cosigner. While Funding U limits loan amounts to $20,000 a year, it's worth considering for undergraduates who need funds in addition to their federal loan allotment.
- Funding U lends only to undergraduate students, and it's one of the few lenders that accept undergraduates with little or no credit history who don't have a cosigner. Even first-year students may apply. In this case, lending decisions will be made on high school academics, state of residence and other factors.

- What is a bad credit student loan?
- A bad credit student loan is a private or federal student loan that's tailored to individuals with a poor credit score — 580 or lower — or thin credit history. Like other student loans, they can only be used for approved academic related expenses, like tuition, books or room and board.
- Most private student loan lenders require that borrowers be in excellent financial shape or have a creditworthy cosigner to get approved. However, lenders that cater to students with bad credit consider factors beyond their score, like academic performance, enrollment or projected career outcomes.
- Pros and cons of bad credit student loans
- Flexible eligibility: Most bad credit loans advertise flexible eligibility requirements and gauge approval on multiple factors, not just credit score.
- Can help you build credit: Consistently making your monthly payments will improve your repayment history, which makes up the largest portion of your FICO credit score.
- Cosigner optionality: Many student loan lenders require a cosigner; they can be helpful when you have bad credit. There are also some bad credit lenders that don't require a cosigner.
- Higher interest rates: Bad credit loans come with higher interest rates than other student loans. If you have a large loan and a high rate, you could be on the hook for thousands of dollars in accrued interest on top of your principal loan amount.
- Smaller borrowing amounts: Many private student loan lenders offer loans that cover up to the total cost of attendance, but it's harder to qualify for a larger loan with a low credit.
- Potential credit risk: If you fail to make the monthly payments your credit could suffer, making it harder to get approved for other loans or products in the future.
- Ask the experts: Can a student loan help you build a better credit score?
- Student Loans and Student Aid Expert, College Admissions and Financial Aid
- "Student loans can help you build a better credit score if you make every required payment on time, by the due date.
- Whatever you do, don’t default and don’t be late with a payment or skip a payment. This can ruin an otherwise good credit score.
- Writer, Personal Loans and Debt Relief
- "A student loan can be instrumental in building up a credit score, but only if you make the payments as scheduled. Thirty-five percent of your FICO credit score consists of your repayment history. Consistently making the monthly payments on time and in full is a sure-fire way to see your score grow. Don't be alarmed if you see your score decrease after applying or after paying down your loan. Those drops are temporary and can be quickly improved with positive repayment habits."
- How bad credit student loans work
- Bad credit student loans are distributed by the Education Department or by a private loan servicer. Funds are often sent directly to your school and are reflected in your student account, rather than your bank account.
- It's common for bad credit lenders to tack on higher interest rates and offer smaller loan amounts than you'd get with a traditional student loan. This is because the lender assumes less risk with creditworthy borrowers. So, it's important to maximize your federal student loans before turning to private regardless of your credit standing. If you do need to take out a private loan, having a creditworthy cosigner can help improve your rate and loan terms.
- Bad credit student loans come with usage restrictions that are set by each lender. However, some private lenders are more lenient than others. For example, one lender may approve necessary technology expenses, like a laptop or tablet, while another could prohibit technology purchases.
- Federal vs. private bad credit student loans
- Federal and private student loans share the same purpose but are very different types of student loans. Here are some of the key differences:
- Current bad credit student loan interest rates
- Private student loan rates vary based on a number of factors including the lender, the type of interest and the borrower's credit background. However, all federal loan borrowers for a given school year receive the same rate, regardless of their credit score. These are the current federal student loan rates for the 2024-25 school year.
- How to get a student loan with bad credit
- Federal student loans don't rely on creditworthiness for approval or rates, making them the best option for getting a student loan with bad credit. To get federal loans, you'll need to fill out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). This application opens on Oct. 1 for the following school year, and it's best to apply early.
- Consider a cosigner: If you have thin or no credit history, you should also consider getting a cosigner for your loan. A cosigner with a good credit score can improve your eligibility odds. Some lenders require undergraduate applicants to add a cosigner.
- Repaying a bad credit student loan
- Federal direct loans come in two forms, subsidized and unsubsidized. Subsidized loans have an interest-free six-month grace period after graduation. Federal unsubsidized loans begin accruing interest immediately after disbursement, but borrowers aren't required to make payments while in school.
- Private student loans operate a bit differently, with some lenders requiring full or interest-only payments while enrolled. Others may not require payments until graduation, but keep in mind that interest will accrue during this time unless stated otherwise.
- Although each private lender is different, most have a couple fixed repayment options for borrowers to choose from that can range anywhere from five to 25 years. Some may offer alternative repayment plans or temporary hardship forbearance, but this isn't common.
- On the other hand, federal loans have a variety of forgiveness and repayment options, including fixed repayment options that last between 10 and 30 years. Borrowers who qualify can also enroll in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan or an occupation-based plan, like Public Service Loan Forgiveness. These plans lower the borrower's monthly payment and forgive the remaining debt after making 20 to 25 years of qualifying payments.
- Alternatives to student loans
- If you don’t qualify for a bad credit student loan, there are several options you can explore, including not going to a four-year school altogether.

- What credit score do I need for a student loan?

Application Process:
- Taking out student loans can be an overwhelming process, especially for those with less-than-ideal credit. For most, a college education is a hefty expense so it's important to look at the potential advantages and disadvantages that come with a bad credit student loan.
- If you need more funding than federal student loans offer, consider applying with a private lender. Applications for bad credit loans are often online and quick to complete. Before diving straight into the application, familiarize yourself with the steps and what the lender needs from you.

Financial Tips:
- Calculate how much you need: Your cost of attendance will determine which lenders and types of loans you look for. Federal student loans typically have lower loan limits than private student loans, so you may need to combine multiple loan types.
- Fill out the FAFSA: The FAFSA determines what type of federal need-based aid you may be eligible for, and it's also required if you want access to federal student loans.
- Compare rates and terms: If you have less-than-stellar credit, your best bet is applying for a federal student loan. However, if you're considering private loans, prequalify with multiple lenders to compare rates and terms.
- Fixed and variable interest rates, fees, penalties and discounts are measured in this category. Higher scores go to lenders with the lowest rates, fewer fees and multiple discounts.

Application Process:
- Since the length of your credit history is the biggest factor in determining your credit score, building up to a prime credit score can take some time — especially if you’ve made some credit missteps in the past. Fortunately, having no credit history can expedite the process since you’re starting with a clean slate.
- The fastest way to build up good credit is by paying your balance on time, which can establish a positive credit history on your FICO report after your first six months and after just a month or two on your VantageScore report.

- Can you get a credit card with no credit history and no job?
- It's possible to access a credit card without a job or a credit history. Here are a few options to consider:
- Find a co-signer: Having a co-signer on your credit card application could bolster your chances of approval depending on the strength of your co-signer’s credit history, income and other factors.
- Get a secured credit card: Rather than income, a secured credit card prioritizes whether or not you can pay a security deposit. If you can afford the upfront cost of a security deposit, then this type of card might be accessible even without a job.
- Apply for a joint credit card account: You can apply for a joint credit card with someone, like a spouse or partner. Both applicants get a credit check, but the income is considered jointly.

- When can you get your first credit card?
- You can’t get approval for your own credit card if you’re under 18. For applicants younger than 21 years old, the Credit CARD Act of 2009 requires proof of independent income or a parent or guardian cosigner.
- Credit card applications also ask for your annual income, so you must have an income source or access to one. If you don’t have an independent source of income, you may list your parent’s, guardian's or partner’s income as long as you have “reasonable expectation of access,” like having a shared bank account.

- How we assess the best cards for building credit
- When evaluating the best cards available with a limited credit history, we consider a mix of factors, including how cards score in our proprietary card rating system and whether cards offer features that make it easy to build credit history while keeping costs low.
- We analyzed over 50 of the most popular cards designed for people with a limited credit history and rated each based on its cost, APR, credit-building features and more to determine whether it belonged in this month’s roundup.
- Build credit, minimize fees
- Cards available with no credit score can include no-annual-fee secured cards, pricey unsecured cards and many options in between. While fees tend to be a bit more forgiving on cards designed for people with limited credit than cards available with bad credit, cost is still a major consideration. As such, cost is a key factor in our credit-building card rating methodology, along with how easy it is to build credit with the card.
- Here’s how overall scoring breaks down for credit-building cards.
- Ease of building credit
- A credit-building card’s cost has a large influence on its overall score and our decision to include it in our best cards list. This is because cards in this category tend to be much pricier than traditional credit cards designed for people with a good or better credit score.
- We compare a card’s total cost, including any annual fees, account activation fees, monthly fees and more against the total cost of other cards in the credit-building category and assign each card a score based on its affordability. We also factor rewards-earning potential into our assessment of a credit-building card’s total cost, subtracting expected earnings from the sum of its fees.
- To get a sense of a credit-building card’s rewards-earning potential, we estimate its average annual rewards rate and average annual earnings based on the most popular spending categories (as covered in the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer spending report).
- However, we use a slightly lower spending assumption ($300 per month or $3,600 per year) to estimate average earnings, assuming credit-builders will start out with a lower credit limit, will want to keep credit utilization low and will focus primarily on small purchases they can easily pay off.
- While low-cost credit-building cards will always be at a major advantage in our scoring system and will likely earn a higher spot on our best cards list, no-annual-fee credit-building cards can be hard to come by, especially if you’re looking for an unsecured card. With this in mind, we may include unsecured cards with high fees in our list if they offer other benefits for credit-builders, like a high starting credit limit or useful perks.
- A card’s APR is also a major factor in its credit-building score. Each card’s average APR is compared against the average APR of other cards in the category, and the cards with lower-than-average APRs receive a higher rating.
- Given the many costs students face — from textbooks to laptops — the presence of an introductory APR on purchases or balance transfers also plays a role in a student card’s score and its inclusion on our list.
- Though high APRs are hard to avoid when you’re just starting out or working on your score, credit-builders and students should strive for as low an APR as possible since they’re likely to either be new to managing cards or trying to establish better financial habits and avoid falling into debt.

- To get a sense of a credit-building card’s rewards-earning potential, we estimate its average annual rewards rate and average annual earnings based on the most popular spending categories (as covered in the latest Bureau of Labor Statistics consumer spending report).
- However, we use a slightly lower spending assumption ($300 per month or $3,600 per year) to estimate average earnings, assuming credit-builders will start out with a lower credit limit, will want to keep credit utilization low and will focus primarily on small purchases they can easily pay off.
- While low-cost credit-building cards will always be at a major advantage in our scoring system and will likely earn a higher spot on our best cards list, no-annual-fee credit-building cards can be hard to come by, especially if you’re looking for an unsecured card. With this in mind, we may include unsecured cards with high fees in our list if they offer other benefits for credit-builders, like a high starting credit limit or useful perks.
- A card’s APR is also a major factor in its credit-building score. Each card’s average APR is compared against the average APR of other cards in the category, and the cards with lower-than-average APRs receive a higher rating.
- Given the many costs students face — from textbooks to laptops — the presence of an introductory APR on purchases or balance transfers also plays a role in a student card’s score and its inclusion on our list.
- Though high APRs are hard to avoid when you’re just starting out or working on your score, credit-builders and students should strive for as low an APR as possible since they’re likely to either be new to managing cards or trying to establish better financial habits and avoid falling into debt.
- A credit-building card’s cost has a large influence on its overall score and our decision to include it in our best cards list. This is because cards in this category tend to be much pricier than traditional credit cards designed for people with a good or better credit score.

- Solid credit-building features
- Along with a credit-building card’s cost, we consider how easy the card makes it to build credit. To assess this, we evaluate its credit limit potential and minimum deposit requirement.
- Unsecured cards with a high starting credit limit and secured cards that let you put down a large deposit and get a matching high credit limit will score the highest according to our “Ease of building credit” rubric and are more likely to appear on our list.
- This is because a high credit limit can make it much easier to keep your credit utilization low, a primary credit-building factor that makes up 30 percent of your FICO credit score.
- Secured cards have a slight advantage in this category since the maximum credit limit on a secured card tends to be much higher than the typical starting credit limit on an unsecured card that’s available with a bad or fair credit score. However, unsecured credit-building cards have the upper hand in another key aspect of building credit: accessibility.
- Cards that carry no or a low deposit requirement can also receive a high score according to our “Ease of building credit” rubric since these cards offer a lower barrier to entry than secured cards that require you to put up hundreds of dollars in an upfront deposit.
- Indeed, some users may prefer to pay a non-refundable $50 annual fee while they work on their credit score than tie up hundreds in a refundable security deposit.

Financial Tips:
- Advice about cards for no credit history
- Most credit cards and loans have credit score requirements for qualification. If you have no credit history, you won’t be able to qualify for many credit cards, especially some of the most valuable rewards cards. Before issuers are willing to work with you, they want to know that you’re a reliable borrower who pays your accounts regularly and on time.
- Here’s some expert advice to help you choose a secured card or another credit-building card that can steer you toward your ultimate financial goals.
- How to choose a card for no credit
- Here are some tips to help you find the right card when you have no credit.
- Review the application requirements. Some cards for no credit history don’t require a credit check or use other means to determine creditworthiness, such as rent payments and financial history. Some also don’t require a Social Security number to apply, but you’ll need to provide basic information to verify your identity.

Some also don’t require a Social Security number to apply, but you’ll need to provide basic information to verify your identity.
- Understand the costs and fees. When you’re focused on building your credit score, you don’t want to risk additional costs that might cause you to carry a balance. Typically, secured credit cards require an upfront security deposit that the issuer uses as collateral if you default on payments. If you don’t want a card that requires a security deposit, consider an unsecured card for building credit.

- Look for additional credit-building features. Opportunities for credit line increases and a security deposit refund are some of the best features to look for. Some issuers let you upgrade to an unsecured card with a potentially higher credit limit once you've established a positive payment history.

- Check for preapproval. A hard inquiry will temporarily lower your credit score, but prequalified offers can help you choose a card you’re more likely to qualify for without risking your credit score. You can use Bankrate's CardMatch™ to get personalized card recommendations.

- Limit your applications. You want to present yourself as a stable applicant, and applying for multiple cards in a short period of time could signal to lenders that you want more credit than you can responsibly handle. Multiple hard credit checks can also add up and temporarily lower your credit score.

Multiple hard credit checks can also add up and temporarily lower your credit score.
- About 28 million Americans are credit invisible, meaning they have no traditional credit report with the three major credit bureaus. Without a documented credit history, lenders have no record of your ability to pay back debt.
- If you’ve never had a credit card and have noticed the Federal Reserve cutting rates to reduce inflation, you might be thinking that lower APRs could make now a good time to apply for your first card and establish a credit history.
- But as someone with limited or no credit, you’re unlikely to be assigned a low rate. Plus, the Fed announced in its most recent meeting that it would pause rate cuts, breaking its three-meeting streak of cuts dating back to September 2024.
- With this in mind, the best time to get a credit card will depend more on how you plan to use it, whether you can afford its fees or a security deposit and if you’re confident you can pay your bill on time and in full. Beyond that, it’s helpful to have a sense of your approval odds before you apply for a given card.
- Our proprietary data indicates that visitors with no credit history who applied for a card on Bankrate in 2024 had an approval rate of about 16 percent — a fairly low approval rate. Although it can be hard to say which individual cards offer the best approval odds, you should have a better chance with cards on this page.
- Along with getting a sense of your approval odds, consider using resources like Reddit and other personal finance subreddits to hear first-hand perspectives from cardholders.
- On Reddit, Discover and Chase cards are among the cards most commonly discussed and suggested as options for people with no credit. In particular, several users in the r/CreditCards subreddit praise the Discover it® Secured Credit Card and Chase Freedom® Rise℠ Card. According to one commenter, the Freedom Rise is “an unsecured credit builder card without any real disadvantages when compared to ‘normal’ cards.” This could the card a great long-term option that holds value even after you’ve built credit history.
- What credit experts think of cards for no credit
- You can choose a secured card or an unsecured card for getting started, but the right choice for you will depend on what you’re most comfortable with and what you can afford. Whichever route you take, it’s best to look for cards that offer a clear upgrade path to better cards once you’ve established a credit history and raised your score.
- Bankrate editor Steve Dashiell offers insight on just how many options you have for building credit, even if you have no credit history.
- “Rather than thinking of your lack of credit history as a negative, think of it as a blank slate. You’re unproven to most lenders, which means that while you may not qualify for some of those juicy high-earning rewards cards, you still have a variety of credit-building options available through most issuers.
- And if you don’t feel comfortable managing your own credit card just yet, you can do what I did: ask to become an authorized user on a trusted family member’s credit card. This lets both of you benefit from the main accountholder’s credit habits but frees you from managing payments. Once your score improves and you become more comfortable with how a credit card works, you can apply for a card in your own name.”

Credit eligibility is not guaranteed. APR and other credit terms depend upon credit score and other key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the amount financed, loan term length, and credit usage and history.

In this example, the borrower will receive $18,226 and will make 36 monthly payments of $642. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $40,000 and loan term lengths range from 24 months to 72 months. Some amounts, rates, and term lengths may be unavailable in certain states.

- Personal loan rate trends
- Despite three federal fund rate cuts in 2024, average personal loan rates have actually risen to 12.38 percent as of Feb. 12, 2025. In the first Fed meeting of 2025, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held rates steady, leaving the target rate at 4.25-4.5 percent.
- Although fewer rate cuts are expected in 2025, Bankrate’s personal loan interest rate forecast for 2025 offers one bright spot: minimum rates for qualified excellent credit borrowers. Chief financial analyst Greg McBride adds that, if rates decrease, it'll be at a very slow pace and that any movement will depend on inflation.
- Personal loan uses
- Borrowers take out different types of personal loans for different loan purposes. While there are many options out there, here are a few of the most common.
- A personal loan may be handy if you want to finance home renovations but don’t have the cash upfront. Using a personal loan for home improvement may be appealing compared to a home equity product. Your house isn't used to secure the loan and isn't at risk if you default.
- What to watch out for: Personal loan terms are usually shorter than home equity products’ terms, which could lead to an unaffordable monthly payment.
- When to get started: Determine how much you need by getting estimates from contractors. If you apply for too little, you’ll have to re-apply for a higher amount, which may necessitate another high credit check.

- How to compare personal loans
- Compare personal loan offers to find the best product for your specific goals. The information Bankrate gathered about the lenders above can make this easier. Keep the following factors in mind as you compare your options.
- Learn the approval requirements: Some lenders cater to excellent credit borrowers, while others specialize in bad credit. Check lender’s websites for loan amount minimums and maximums to make sure they meet your needs.
- Review interest rates and fees: Personal loan APRs vary widely based on your credit score and the lender. Watch for origination fees, which can be as high as 12 percent of your loan amount and are deducted from the amount you borrow when your loan funds.
- Run payments on different repayment options: Most loan terms range between one and seven years. A longer term comes with a lower monthly payment and higher total interest charges. A short term makes sense if you can afford the higher monthly payment and want your debt repaid faster.
- Look for special perks and read lender reviews: You may be eligible for rate discounts for automatic payments or payment due date flexibility. Read lender reviews for extra information about customer service hours, contact information and what other borrowers' experiences have been.
- "As someone who used to broker loans for a living, I know that the lowest rate lenders are not always the best choice for your circumstances. Those low rates may come with extra fees, short terms, and requirements that don’t fit your financial needs or that you can’t qualify for. A lender that offers slightly higher rates but longer terms may give your budget more breathing room than a lender that offers super low rates on loan balances you have to pay off quickly at a high monthly payment."

- Personal loan interest rates
- The interest rate you're offered will depend on several factors, including your credit score, your income, your current debts, the Federal Reserve's actions and the type of loan you're interested in.
- Current personal loan interest rates
- Rates by credit score
- Average personal loan interest rates vary depending on your credit score. Lenders offer borrowers with fair or bad credit higher rates because they see them as more likely to default.
- Borrowers with good or excellent credit are more eligible for the lender's most competitive rates and terms. Lenders often also charge lower rates for shorter terms, higher loan amounts and may offer discounts for auto payment set up.
- Check your credit score to calculate your potential interest rate.
- To get an up-to-date picture of industry rates, Bankrate's Market Analysis team conducts the weekly Bankrate Monitor survey. The rate we share is the average offered by America's largest banks and thrifts to customers with a 700 FICO score, $5,000 loan amount and three-year repayment plan.
- Your rate could be much lower or higher than the average depending on your credit score or loan term.
- What is a personal loan?
- A personal loan is a type of installment loan that allows you to receive money all at once and repay it in monthly installments. Most personal loans can be funded in one or two business days, and repaid in terms ranging from one to seven years.
- Personal loan rates are usually fixed with average APRs much lower than average credit card APRs. They’re typically unsecured, so you don’t risk losing an asset like your home or car if you can’t repay it. Personal loans are popular for debt consolidation but can be used for just about any legal purpose.
- Pros and cons of personal loans
- While helpful, personal loans aren't the best financing tool or solution for everyone. Consider the pros and cons of personal loans before making a decision. If you feel that the drawbacks outweigh the benefits, look into personal loan alternatives, like home equity products or a credit card.
- Money in one lump sum with lower interest rates than credit cards.
- Faster funding times than secured loan options like home equity loans.
- May help improve your credit score if used to pay off revolving credit.
- Interest rates can be higher than credit cards for bad credit borrowers.
- Income must be stable to qualify — not good for gig or self-employed income.
- 45 percent of Americans who applied for personal loans in the last 12 months were rejected, according to Bankrate's 2025 Credit Denials Survey.

- Does it make more sense to borrow with a personal loan or a HELOC right now?
- Nationally recognized finance expert
- Recent spikes in mortgage rates may make personal loans a better choice than home equity loans. People with high credit scores may find personal loan rates as competitive as home equity loan interest rates. In addition, a personal loan isn’t secured by your home, which means you don’t have to pay it off when you sell your home, and don’t risk losing your home to foreclosure if you can’t pay it off.
- Loans Senior Writer
- Despite the record highs in home equity, I’d recommend personal loans as a better alternative for two reasons. First, they don’t tie up your home’s equity since they’re typically unsecured. That means you net more profit if you plan to sell your home soon and avoid the risk of losing your home if you can’t repay the HELOC. Second, you could keep using a HELOC over at least the first 10 years, reducing your housing wealth. A personal loan forces you to pick a repayment period with a definite end date. Homeowners who rack up credit card debt over the holidays may be better off using a personal loan for debt consolidation, too.

- How does a personal loan affect your credit score?
- A personal loan can impact your credit score in a negative or positive way, depending on how you manage it. Applying for a loan will temporarily drop your credit score by a few points, but adding a new credit type to your mix and making payments responsibly can raise your score over time.
- However, if you default on a personal loan, your credit will take a huge hit. It can also remain on your credit report for up to seven years, which can make it difficult to get approved for loans down the road.

- Should I take out a personal loan?
- Personal loans make the most sense if you have a steady, reliable income and want a definite payoff date.  They’re also a good option for fast cash in an emergency if your savings are low or non-existent.
- They’re also an excellent tool to improve your credit score, if you use them to pay off credit cards and lock the cards away.  Finally, homeowners can borrow money for improvements and leave their home equity intact.

Eligibility Criteria:
- Your mortgage lender can help you determine whether you qualify for a first-time homebuyer program and apply for one if you do. You can also check out your state’s housing finance agency (HFA) website to learn about eligibility criteria and search for participating lenders.
- Before you apply, start preparing financially. Look into building your credit to buy a home and saving for the upfront costs of homebuying, such as the down payment and closing costs.
- A first-time homebuyer refers to a homebuyer who hasn’t owned a home previously. However, many programs define “first-time homebuyer” as a buyer who hasn’t owned a home within the past three years. Depending on the program, the qualifications might also include not exceeding a certain income or buying a home above a specific price point, as well as having a certain minimum credit score or down payment contribution.
- Which loan is best for first-time homebuyers?
- The best type of mortgage for a first-time homebuyer, or any borrower, is one that’s affordable. This could be any type of mortgage that has a reasonable interest rate, lower down payment requirement or low or no mortgage insurance.
- That said, many first-time buyers go with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage because the monthly payments are lower than those for a mortgage with a shorter term. Two popular 30-year fixed-rate choices: conventional loans and FHA loans.

- First-time homebuyer education programs are designed to help you understand the various aspects of owning a home. To qualify for many first-time buyer loan programs, you’ll need to take a course. If you’re obtaining a conventional loan, you might be able to take the Fannie Mae HomeView online class to satisfy this requirement. Check with your loan officer to learn your options.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/reviews/hippo-insurance

Eligibility Criteria:
- Hippo understands how reliant modern customers are on technology. With this in mind, the company wanted to create the best home insurance for homeowners who want a tech-first approach. This includes higher coverage limits for computers and home office equipment, meaning the company might be a good choice for someone who works from home. Homeowners can also receive coverage for electronics, appliances and essential staff, like a house cleaner or babysitter. Water backup coverage and service line coverage are also offered, but availability may vary based on location and eligibility.
- Hippo has plans to expand but it is currently only available in 40 states. But, because Hippo partners with several different underwriting partners, policies may not be available everywhere it claims. The company’s limited availability, lack of J.D. Power customer and claims satisfaction scores and absence of local agencies brought down its Bankrate Score, earning 2.6 out of 5.0 stars for 2024.

Application Process:
- Fast online quote process
- Hippo offers numerous discounts that may help policyholders save on homeowners insurance. Hippo calculates the discounts you qualify for during the online quote process. Potential discount opportunities include:
- Homebuyer discount: For new policies, a discount may apply to those who acquired their home on the effective date of the new policy or within the 12 months leading up to it. Upon renewal, customers might be eligible for a discount, provided it was part of the original policy term and there have been no interruptions in coverage.
- Coverage.com, LLC is a licensed insurance producer (NPN: 19966249). Coverage.com services are only available in states where it is licensed. Coverage.com may not offer insurance coverage in all states or scenarios. All insurance products are governed by the terms in the applicable insurance policy, and all related decisions (such as approval for coverage, premiums, commissions and fees) and policy obligations are the sole responsibility of the underwriting insurer. The information on this site does not modify any insurance policy terms in any way.

- Lemonade might appeal to homeowners who want to handle their policies digitally. The Lemonade app is where you’ll handle most policy changes, claims and other management tasks, although phone service is available if you need it. Lemonade is also a Certified B Corporation. Corporate sustainability is built into its operating structure, which may appeal to you if you value social and environmental responsibility.
- Many praised Hippo’s low average rates, but the consensus around the claims process was mixed. Some praised Hippo’s speedy response times and transparency throughout the claims process; however, other policyholders had more negative experiences with the Hippo claims department.
- The claims process will vary based on multiple factors like your location, home age and extent of the damage — but this inconsistency could be exacerbated by the fact that Hippo uses multiple underwriting partners.
- If you need to file a home insurance claim with Hippo, you can call 1-855-999-9746 or file a claim online. If filing over the phone, you’ll be paired with one of Hippo’s dedicated claims concierges to walk you through the process. You’ll likely need your policy number, the date of the loss and some details about what happened. Your Hippo claims representative will review the claims details and your coverage and will guide you through the process to resolving your loss.

- Hippo claims that its average response time for claims is five to seven days, or between 30 to 50 percent faster than competitors. Keep in mind that this is simply a response time, not a payout time frame. According to Hippo’s website, the time it takes to receive a payout usually ranges from several weeks to several months. Your claims experience could vary depending on your state laws, your policy and the type of claim you filed. To learn more about its claims process, contact Hippo.

- The homeowners also have a $1,000 deductible, a $500 hail deductible and a 2 percent hurricane deductible (or the next closest deductible amounts that are available) where separate deductibles apply.
- Bankrate Scores
- Our Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impacts policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. Each factor was added to a category, and these categories were weighted in a tiered approach to analyze how companies perform in key customer-impacting categories.
- Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
- Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
- In May 2024, Bankrate collaborated with market research firm SliceMR to survey over 1,500 insurance customers nationwide, asking policyholders to rate their insurer’s cost, coverage, customer support and overall experience on a five-point scale. Bankrate and SliceMR collected and analyzed these customer ratings, along with website analytics and responses to three open-ended questions regarding customer experience. Responses are based on individual policyholders’ policy details and personal experience, and therefore cannot be verified for accuracy. Users received an incentive for their feedback. All ratings are unedited and have not been reviewed or approved by insurance carriers. User-generated ratings are separate from carrier Bankrate Scores — which are calculated based on our proprietary methodology — and may not match.

Financial Tips:
- Partners with multiple third-party companies to underwrite policies
- Because Hippo does not underwrite its home insurance, there is not an NAIC Complaint Index available for the company. The NAIC does, however, assign complaint indexes for one of Hippo’s largest underwriting partners, Spinnaker. From 2021 to 2023, Spinnaker’s complaint index has rapidly climbed. However, keep in mind that Spinnaker is just one of Hippo’s multiple underwriting partners; customer complaints will vary based on which company underwriters your policy.
- Hippo home insurance advertises that it is available in 40 states excluding Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Wyoming. However, because Hippo uses multiple underwriting companies, it may not be available in all of the 40 states it claims to write policies in.

Financial Tips:
- 5 credit card application tips
- Regularly check your credit report. Keep tabs on your credit reports from the three credit reporting bureaus and dispute any discrepancies. You can usually check your credit report for free once a year at AnnualCreditReport.com.
- Do all you can to improve credit score. Paying your credit card bill in full and on time each month is one of the best ways to improve your credit score over time. You should also work to keep your credit utilization ratio low and diversify your credit mix to help boost your score.
- Don't fill out too many applications at once. Carefully shop for and compare credit cards before you apply. Each card application results in a hard credit pull, which can affect your overall score if you have too many credit checks in a short period.
- Only apply where your approval chances are high. Only apply for cards that align with your current credit score range so you have the best chances for approval. If you have a low credit score, don't apply for a premium travel card. Inversely, if you have a great score, you shouldn't apply for a secured card.
- Know what happens if you're denied. Not all credit card applications go the way we want them too. If your application is denied, the issuer is required by law to send a letter in the mail explaining why.

Application Process:
- In truth, I built my excellent credit by setting automatic payments on my cards for the full statement balance each month and treating every purchase as though I were paying in cash. I didn’t push hard on rewards or open new accounts until I was far more confident in my ability to handle a card. It’s a slow and steady process, and you shouldn’t rush it.
- Editor, Credit Cards
- I built my credit to excellent by accident. It wasn’t my goal. I just focused on paying the bill on time, even if it was just the minimum, and not letting my balance get too high. Even during brief periods of unemployment, I did that. Years later, I have excellent credit and I maintain it by keeping both those habits, but also by making sure I don’t apply for anything big back-to-back, like a car loan or another credit card.

- Adding an authorized user to your credit cards serves two purposes. First, it can help build the authorized user's credit score if you use the card responsibly. A great example would be adding your child as an authorized user when they are younger. Even if they never touch the card, they will have an established credit history, giving them a significant advantage. Second, some credit card perks may also be extended to the authorized user. For example, some cards that offer Priority Pass Membership also grant authorized users access.

- Cards for excellent credit news & views
- Credit card and other financial product application denials skyrocketed since the Federal Reserve began hiking interest rates in March 2022. These rate hikes have kept credit card interest rates fairly high, whether you have excellent credit or not. After the Federal Reserve initially cut interest rates, mortgage rates have gone down and auto loan rates are expected to follow. However, credit card interest rates have largely stayed the same. But that isn’t a reason to stall your credit-building. You should continue to aim for and keep excellent credit to qualify for the best cards.
- Just remember that having excellent credit doesn’t mean you should go on a card application spree.
- One Redditor* says in a post on the r/CreditCards subreddit, “… aggressive credit-seeking and addition of many accounts in recent months is a sign of elevated risk and one that will return denials from many, if not most lenders.” While you might know you aren’t a risk, the same commenter points out that if you apply for too many cards too fast, “That makes it look even more desperate since you've crammed so many into close succession having not done so previously. It looks like you could be experiencing financial strain.”
- While the number of hard credit inquires on your reports can affect your approval chances, your score itself — and the credit tier your score falls into — is a great guideline to follow when comparing new cards. Having excellent credit doesn't guarantee approval, but it certainly helps. According to Bankrate's proprietary data of users who applied for cards on our site from February 2024 to February 2025, people with excellent credit were about twice as likely to get approved for credit cards.
- Assessing data, news and how others utilize cards with excellent credit along with your spending habits and personal finance goals can help you find your ideal cards to maximize your spending and reward your excellent credit score.
- You can also use tools like Bankrate's CardMatch™ to assess your chances with some cards. If you check preapproval odds before applying, you can apply for your next card with more confidence.

- How many credit cards can I have and still maintain excellent credit?
- There is no perfect number of credit cards you should have to maintain excellent credit. However, the more available credit you have, the easier it is to maintain low credit utilization. Keep in mind that applying for too many credit cards in a short period could temporarily lower your score. Only carry as many cards as you can manage responsibly.

- How we assess the best cards for excellent credit
- When evaluating the best credit cards available with an excellent credit score, we take into account several factors, including how cards score in our proprietary card rating system and whether they offer features that fit the priorities of a diverse group of cardholders, from earning rewards to scoring a large sign-up bonus to saving on interest.
- We analyzed over 250 of the most popular credit cards and selected standouts that require excellent credit. We scored each card based on the factors most relevant to its primary category, including its rewards rate, estimated annual earnings, intro APR period, ongoing APR, perks and more to determine whether it belonged in this month’s roundup.
- One of the key perks of having an excellent credit score is being able to qualify for the most lucrative rewards credit cards. As such, our rating methodology focuses heavily on rewards value — what kind of return we’d expect based on the average person’s spending and a card’s added bonuses and annual fee.
- Here’s a quick breakdown of the key factors in our scoring methodology for rewards cards — the category most relevant to cardholders with excellent credit.
- Since many cardholders with excellent credit are eager to earn rewards, a key criteria for a card’s inclusion in our list is whether it offers impressive rewards value. This includes a card’s average rewards rate, estimated annual rewards earnings, sign-up bonus value and reward redemption value.
- We use consumer spending data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to get a reliable third-party measure of people’s spending habits. The most recent BLS data estimates average total spending in 2023 was $77,280 per consumer. We then narrow our focus to which purchases are likely to be put on a credit card and earn rewards, subtracting expenditures like housing, vehicle purchases and education. This gives us a total “chargeable” annual spend of around $22,500.
- With these calculations complete, we assign each card a score based on how its average rewards earnings, sign-up bonus value, rewards rate and redemption value stack up against other cards in its primary category.
- The better these values, the higher its score will be, making it more worthy of inclusion in our list and increasing its potential ranking.

- Since many cardholders with excellent credit are eager to earn rewards, a key criteria for a card’s inclusion in our list is whether it offers impressive rewards value. This includes a card’s average rewards rate, estimated annual rewards earnings, sign-up bonus value and reward redemption value.
- We use consumer spending data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to get a reliable third-party measure of people’s spending habits. The most recent BLS data estimates average total spending in 2023 was $77,280 per consumer. We then narrow our focus to which purchases are likely to be put on a credit card and earn rewards, subtracting expenditures like housing, vehicle purchases and education. This gives us a total “chargeable” annual spend of around $22,500.

- The better these values, the higher its score will be, making it more worthy of inclusion in our list and increasing its potential ranking.
- We also rate all cards based on how their ongoing average APR compares to the average APR you’ll find other cards in their primary category. However, the impact of an especially high or low APR on a card’s overall score depends on its primary category.
- For rewards-earning cards, this factor has only a minor influence on the card’s score and whether the card is included in our list, since rewards card users generally try to avoid carrying a balance. That said, rewards-earning cards may get a solid boost in score and be more worthy of inclusion in our list if they also offer an intro APR on balance transfers or new purchases, since such offers aren’t always present on these cards.
- More important to these cards’ scores and their inclusion in our list is how their annual fees influence their overall value. We consider a card’s annual fee in two ways — how it ranks relative to the fees you’ll find on other cards in the category and how it impacts a card’s overall rewards value.
- Cards with an annual fee will always be at a slight disadvantage in our scoring system since annual fees inherently cut into your rewards value. However, if a card offers terrific value via its ongoing rewards and perks, it can earn a high score and a spot in our list even if it carries a high annual fee. After all, the highest rewards rates and most valuable perks are often found on cards with annual fees.
- Interest rates and intro APR offers play a much larger role in a card’s score and whether it’s included in our list when the card is designed specifically for users looking to save on interest charges, such as dedicated balance transfer or low-interest cards.

- The eight lenders featured here rank as “the best” because, among financial institutions offering HE loans, they had the highest Bankrate Scores.
- To determine a home equity lender's Bankrate Score, Bankrate rates lenders on a scale of one (1) to five (5) stars — with five (5) the highest rating — based on a variety of factors relating to the lender's products and services. To assign our ratings, we assessed each mortgage lender across three core areas:
- Availability: Licensing - 50%; credit score - 20%; loan minimum - 10%; draw requirement - 10%; loan products - 10%
- Borrower experience: Rate transparency - 45%; convenience - 35%; customer service - 10%; fixed-rate options - 10%
- How does a home equity loan work?
- Also known as a second mortgage or second lien, a home equity loan works by letting you borrow against the equity you have in your home. Typically, they are loans with fixed interest rates and terms range from five to 30 years. You’re given the funds in a lump sum once you close on the loan and you’ll begin repaying the loan right away. Like your mortgage, they’re secured by your home, so failure to pay can result in foreclosure and the loss of your home.
- What to consider when choosing a home equity loan lender
- When shopping for a home equity loan, there are several factors to consider:
- Availability: Research not only what lenders are in your area, but what specific products they offer. Many lenders may have a presence in your state, but not offer home equity loans there.
- Financial requirements: Home equity loans aren’t as standardized as mortgages. For example, some lenders may require you to maintain 25 percent equity, whereas others only require 10 percent. Some may require a credit score of 620 while others require 700.
- Rates: Interest rates and APRs can also vary between lenders. Shop multiple lenders to compare the overall costs of the loan.
- Contact options: Is it important your lender has in-person branch offices nearby? Do they have weekend customer service hours? How is their online banking? It’s good to know how you can contact a lender with an issue before getting a loan from them.
- How much equity do I typically need to have in my home before I can get a home equity loan?
- Usually, you’ll need more than 20 percent equity to get a home equity loan. How much more depends on how much you want to borrow. Most lenders require a combined-loan-to-volume (CLTV) of 80 percent or less, though some lenders may go as high as 90 percent. At 80 percent CLTV, you must maintain at least 20 percent equity in the home.

Application Process:
- When interest rates fall, you might choose to refinance your mortgage to a new loan at a lower rate. The process isn’t much different from your original mortgage application, and you’ll likely pay less in closing costs this time around compared to when you first bought a home.While most borrowers today have mortgages with already-low rates, there are still some instances when refinancing might make sense. If you’re considering refinancing, think about your goals. Do you want to save money? Take cash out? Pay off your mortgage faster? Get a fixed rate? Borrowers refinance for these and many other reasons.

- What are bad credit auto loans?
- Auto loans are secured loans that use the car you buy as collateral. A bad credit auto loan is essentially the same as a normal auto loan, but it usually has a more expansive acceptance criteria at the trade off of higher rates and fees.
- You are typically asked to pay a fixed interest rate and make monthly payments for 24 to 84 months, at which point your car will be paid off. Many dealerships offer their own financing, but you can also find auto loans at national banks, local credit unions and online lenders.
- While you are unlikely to qualify for the lowest auto loan rates, you should still take the time to apply for preapproval before you visit a dealership. This will help you get the most competitive offer from lenders that offer car loans for bad credit.
- Auto loan rates by credit score
- This answer varies by specific lender, but the better your score is, the better your rates and terms will be. If you have low or no credit, you may still qualify for a loan but should expect a higher average auto loan rate.
- In the fourth quarter of 2024, drivers with scores of 500 or lower received an average rate of 15.75 percent for new and 21.81 percent for used cars, according to Experian — both up from third quarter numbers. However, these borrowers accounted for a small portion of approved loans. Those with scores between 500 and 600 fared better, with rates of 13.08 percent and 19.38 percent for new and used cars, respectively.
- How to apply for car loans with bad credit
- It is possible to get a car loan with bad credit, although having bad credit will raise the rates you're offered. If you are having trouble getting approved or finding acceptable rates, follow these steps:
- Check your credit score: At least 30 days before you plan on applying, check your credit report and your credit score. Dispute any inaccurate information to get it removed and boost your score.
- Reduce existing debt: Before applying for an auto loan, pay down as much debt as you can and avoid opening new accounts.
- Get a cosigner: A cosigner with good credit will take on some responsibility for your loan if you default, but they can also help you qualify for the loan and potentially for a lower rate.
- Make a large down payment: A larger down payment will lower your monthly payment, and it could also help you qualify for better rates because it reduces the amount you have to finance.
- Apply for preapproval: Auto loan preapproval allows you to visit a dealership like a cash buyer. You can start your search on Bankrate to see what rates you could qualify for.
- What to consider when refinancing your car with bad credit
- If you are applying to refinance loan with poor credit, keep your loan amount, as well as the mileage and age of your vehicle, in mind.
- Vehicle mileage: Lenders will only refinance vehicles between 80,000 miles and 120,000 miles, though most will only accept vehicles with less than 100,000 miles.
- Age of vehicle: Many lenders will not refinance a vehicle over 10 years old, but there may be exceptions for antique or collector vehicles.
- Loan amount: You will be required to have a minimum amount left on your loan, but the exact balance depends on your lender.
- Pros and cons of car loans for bad credit
- Securing vehicle financing aimed at poor credit borrowers can be an excellent way to get a car, but it comes with risks. Consider the benefits and drawbacks of a bad credit auto loan.
- On-time payments can improve your credit score.
- Less stringent credit requirements.
- Can taking out an auto loan help build your credit?
- Nationally recognized finance expert
- Yes, it can! Payment history is 35% of your FICO score. If you make your monthly payments on time, this helps build a solid credit score. An auto loan also contributes to your credit mix, which makes up 10% of your score. Do keep in mind that an auto loan can also damage your score if you make late payments. So make sure you set up a system that reminds you when bills are due.
- Auto loans expert
- Taking out any new credit product will have an impact on your credit score, both positively and negatively. On its own, taking out a car loan does not increase your credit. Your credit may actually take an initial drop following your application due to the hard pull. However, if you are able to keep up with your monthly payments and remain in good standing, then you will likely see a boost. But this doesn’t happen overnight, and the risk of a vehicle loan damaging your credit is not one to be ignored.
- How to choose the best bad credit auto loan
- Choosing the right auto financing for bad credit and best lender for you is critical to getting the most competitive rate. Choose lenders based on which loan fits your budget and financial needs. When shopping for an auto loan, compare the annual percentage rate (APR) each lender offers in addition to other factors like repayment options and approval requirements.
- Approval requirements

Application Process:
- Adding your child to your car insurance is a fairly simple process, but it comes with unique challenges, from increased premiums to added stress. In fact, some families may choose to delay adding a child to their insurance policy to reduce costs and minimize the complications that come with getting on the road as a teen. In this guide, we’ll explore the legal and financial implications of adding a child to car insurance, along with practical guidance for completing the process.
- Coverage.com, LLC is a licensed insurance producer (NPN: 19966249). Coverage.com services are only available in states where it is licensed. Coverage.com may not offer insurance coverage in all states or scenarios. All insurance products are governed by the terms in the applicable insurance policy, and all related decisions (such as approval for coverage, premiums, commissions and fees) and policy obligations are the sole responsibility of the underwriting insurer. The information on this site does not modify any insurance policy terms in any way.

- Lower premiums for your child: If your teen is 18 or older, they could purchase a policy in their name (assuming they own, lease or finance their own car). However, car insurance for 18-year-olds on their own is generally pretty expensive, with an average annual rate of $7,367 per year for full coverage. If your teen lives with you and if your name is also on their vehicle, they’ll likely save money by staying on your policy.
- Additionally, adding your teen to your car insurance policy could present a learning opportunity. By involving your teen in the shopping process, you can teach them how to read a car insurance policy and help build their financial literacy.
- Driver education course completion documentation
- Unlike health insurance, there’s no specific age when your child can’t be listed on your auto insurance policy. As long as they are still living with you and you have an insurable interest in the vehicle they drive, your child should be able to stay on your policy. However, if any of the following factors below apply, it may be time for your child to be on their own policy.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/retirement/roth-ira-plan-calculator


Application Process:
- At Bankrate, we aim to provide reliable personal finance information. We value your feedback.
- Annual contributions: The amount you will contribute to your Roth IRA each year. This calculator assumes that you make your contribution at the beginning of each year. It is important to note that this is the maximum total contributed to all of your IRA accounts. The contribution limit is adjusted for inflation over time.If you are age 50 or older you can make an additional 'catch-up' contribution of $1,000. The 'catch-up' contribution amount of $1,000 is not subject to a cost-of-living adjustment. In order to qualify for the 'catch-up' contribution, you must turn 50 by the end of the year in which you are making the contribution.
- If the contribution amount you input is less than $6,500, the calculator will use that number for all ages until retirement age.
- If the amount you input is over $7,500 then the calculator assumes you want to maximize contributions, so both contribution limits will be applied, as determined by your age.
- If the contribution amount you input is less than $6,500, the calculator will use that number for all ages until retirement age.
- If the amount you input is over $7,500 then the calculator assumes you want to maximize contributions, so both contribution limits will be applied, as determined by your age.
- *For the purposes of this calculator, we assume you are not Married filing separately and contributing to a Roth IRA. High income individuals have the option to make non-deductible traditional IRA contributions and then immediately convert them to a Roth IRA. This process, known as a backdoor Roth IRA, can effectively eliminate the income phase-out for Roth IRA contributions.
- Age of retirement: Age you wish to retire. This calculator assumes that the year you retire, you do not make any contributions to your IRA. So if you retire at age 65, your last contribution is assumed to have happened when you were actually 64.
- Expected rate of return: The annual rate of return for your IRA. This calculator assumes that your return is compounded annually and your contributions are made at the beginning of each year. The actual rate of return is largely dependent on the types of investments you select. The Standard & Poor's 500® (S&P 500®) for the 10 years ending April 28, 2023, had an annual compounded rate of return of 12.37 percent, including reinvestment of dividends. The S&P 500 has returned about 10 percent annually over the long term.Savings accounts at a financial institution may pay as little as 0.25% or less but carry significantly lower risk of loss of principal balances and are typically FDIC insured.
- Marginal tax rate: The marginal tax rate you expect to pay on your taxable investments. Use the table below to assist you in estimating your federal tax rate. The taxable account results assume that all investment returns are taxed as income and/or short-term capital gains.
- Filing status and income tax rates 2022-2023

Eligibility Criteria:
- (1) Checking a rate through us generates a soft credit inquiry on a person’s credit report, which is visible only to that person. A hard credit inquiry, which is visible to that person and others, and which may affect that person’s credit score, only appears on the person’s credit report if and when a loan is issued to the person. Credit eligibility is not guaranteed. APR and other credit terms depend upon credit score and other key financing characteristics, including but not limited to the amount financed, loan term length, and credit usage and history.
- (2) Between October 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024, Personal Loans issued by LendingClub Bank were funded within 22 hours after loan approval, on average. 57% of Personal Loans issued by LendingClub Bank during the same period were funded within 24 hours after loan approval. Loan approval, and the time it takes to issue a credit decision, are not guaranteed and individual results vary based on creditworthiness and other factors, including but not limited to investor demand.
- A representative example of payment terms for a Personal Loan is as follows: a borrower receives a loan of $19,389 for a term of 36 months, with an interest rate of 11.75% and a 6.00% origination fee of $1,163 for an APR of 16.10%. In this example, the borrower will receive $18,226 and will make 36 monthly payments of $642. Loan amounts range from $1,000 to $40,000 and loan term lengths range from 24 months to 72 months. Some amounts, rates, and term lengths may be unavailable in certain states.
- For Personal Loans, APR ranges from 7.90% to 35.99% and origination fee ranges from 0.00% to 8.00% of the loan amount. APRs and origination fees are determined at the time of application. Lowest APR is available to borrowers with excellent credit. Advertised rates and fees are valid as of Jan 9, 2025 and are subject to change without notice.
- Unless otherwise specified, loans are made by LendingClub Bank, N.A., Member FDIC (“LendingClub Bank”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of LendingClub Corporation, NMLS ID 167439. LendingClub Bank is not an affiliate of Bankrate and is not responsible for the products and services provided by Bankrate.
- For example, a three-year $10,000 personal loan would have an interest rate of 9.88% and a 7.99% origination fee for an annual percentage rate (APR) of 15.70% APR. You would receive $9,201 and make 36 scheduled monthly payments of $322.11. A five-year $10,000 personal loan would have an interest rate of 11.64% and a 7.99% origination fee with a 15.36% APR. You would receive $9,201 and make 60 scheduled monthly payments of $220.63. Origination fees vary between 1% and 9.99%. Personal loan APRs through Prosper range from 8.99% to 35.99%, with the lowest rates for the most creditworthy borrowers. Eligibility for personal loans up to $50,000 depends on the information provided by the applicant in the application form. Eligibility for personal loans is not guaranteed, and requires that a sufficient number of investors commit funds to your account and that you meet credit and other conditions. Refer to Borrower Registration Agreement for details and all terms and conditions. All personal loans made by WebBank.

- Calculate your home improvement loan payment
- Use Bankrate's loan calculator to determine the best loan repayment plan for you. Enter different loan amounts, terms, and interest rates to understand your estimated monthly payments and the total interest cost.
- How to compare home improvement loan lenders
- It's always best to get quotes from a few lenders before applying for a loan so you can determine the best offer. When comparing lenders, keep an eye on these factors.
- Approval requirements: Every lender sets its own threshold for approving potential borrowers. They consider your income, credit score and debt-to-income ratio. If you have below-average credit, look for lenders that use other approval criteria. Some will consider your area of study or job history.
- Cosigners: Adding a cosigner may boost your approval odds of getting low rates if you have fair or poor credit, but not all lenders offer this option.
- Loan amounts: The scope of your home project or repair sets how much you need to borrow. If you are remodeling your kitchen, you will likely need a larger loan than just replacing an appliance. Ensure the lender offers loan amounts as high or low as you need.
- Repayment options: A good home improvement loan lender usually offers repayment terms ranging from 12 to 84 months. The longer the term, the lower the monthly payment — but the more interest you pay over the life of the loan.
- Unique features: Look for lenders with any unique perks or restrictions. For example, some lenders offer discounts if you set up automatic payments from your bank account. Others may charge a fee if you pay the loan off before the full term.
- Bankrate home improvement loans rate update
- Despite three Fed rate cuts in 2024, mortgage rates have barely budged. However, some home improvement personal loan lenders offer excellent credit personal loan rates below those offered on mortgages and home equity loans, making them worth a look for any home improvement needs you may have. And remember: They aren't typically secured, so you won't tie up your home equity if you need to get your house showroom-ready for this year's spring buying season.
- Can I borrow more on my mortgage for home improvement?
- Senior writer, Loans
- Yes, but with mortgage rates remaining stubbornly high despite recent Fed rate cuts, it might not be cost-effective. However, if you bought a fixer-upper in the last year or two, the best option may be one you don’t hear a lot about — a renovation loan. A loan like the Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation loan allows you to roll the labor, materials and closing costs into one loan up to 97 percent of your home’s value. That's much more than the 80 percent cap you'll find with a regular cash-out refinance. What’s even better: The loan is based on the estimated value of your home after renovations, giving you even more borrowing power. There are a few drawbacks. First, the lender will need to approve your project. Second, funds are disbursed in draws rather than all at once.
- Student Loans and Student Aid Expert, College Admissions and Financial Aid
- There are several options for borrowing more on your mortgage to pay for repairs and renovation. These include a cash-out refinance, a FHA 203(k) loan, a Fannie Mae HomeStyle loan and a Freddie Mac CHOICERenovation Mortgage. There are also Energy-Efficient Mortgages, or EEMs, that let you finance energy-efficient improvements to your home as part of an FHA or VA mortgage. Homeowners should compare the cost with obtaining a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC), since those options may be less expensive or more flexible.
- What are home improvement loans?
- A home improvement loan is a financing option used to pay for home remodeling and repairs. Loan amounts for personal loans used for home improvement can range from $1,000 to $100,000, with standard repayment terms between one and seven years.
- Home improvement personal loans are unsecured installment loans, meaning they have a fixed interest rate and stable monthly payment for a set period. Because your home doesn’t secure them, you don’t risk losing your property if you default on the loan. Once approved, you receive the entire lump sum, in some cases, as soon as the same day you apply.
- You'll then make regular principal and interest payments until the balance is paid in full. Most unsecured home improvement loans don't have a prepayment penalty, and don't require any assessment of your home's value for approval.
- Pros and cons of home improvement loans
- Weigh the pros and cons — like the minimal paperwork against a short repayment timeline — before using a loan to pay for home improvements.
- Funds may be available the same day you apply.
- Less approval paperwork and faster approval than secured options.
- Approval doesn't depend on your home's value.
- Interest rates may be lower than mortgage options.
- No risk of foreclosure since loans are unsecured.
- Home improvement loans may come with higher origination fees and APRs.
- Fees may be significantly higher than other home improvement loans.
- No interest-tax deduction since the loan is not secured by your home.
- Types of home improvement loans and their uses
- There are many different types of home improvement loans. These are some of the most common:
- Personal loans
- Personal loans are unsecured loans that can be used for almost any purpose. Well-qualified borrowers may be able to qualify for loans with competitive interest rates under 8 percent and repayment terms of up to seven years. Approval and rates are based on your credit score and history.
- Who it’s best for: Personal loans are best for those who want quick cash to get a project going and want to avoid using their home as collateral to secure a loan. They also tend to be best for borrowers with excellent credit, with rates that may be lower than home equity loans.
- What to watch out for: Personal loans may have higher payments since the standard maximum term is seven years. You may also pay higher interest rates and fees if your credit is fair to bad. You also won't be able to borrow more than $100,000 in most cases, which is less than the $250,000 or more offered by many home equity lenders. And don't forget: Interest on unsecured personal home improvement loans isn't tax-deductible.
- When to get started: You should start looking for personal loans when you have a reasonable idea of how much you need to borrow. Funds can be delivered quickly, and many lenders offer same or next-day application approval. That is good news if you need to pay money upfront to contractors to get your improvements started.
- How to get started: Look for lenders offering loans within your credit score and loan amount range. Then, get prequalified with at least three lenders. Compare the rates and fees to ensure you get the best offer.

- Home equity loans
- Home equity loans are lump-sum, secured loans that use your home as collateral. Because terms are usually 15 to 30 years, you can expect a lower monthly payment than a personal loan. But make sure to understand how a longer term impacts the total interest you pay over time.
- Who it’s best for: Home equity loans are best for homeowners with significant equity in their home and prefer the lower payment that comes with longer repayment term periods. Many home equity lenders allow you to borrow up to 85 percent of your home’s value. A bonus: Interest you pay on home equity loans may be deductible when you file your taxes.
- What to watch out for: Home equity loans use your home as collateral. That means you could lose your home if you default on your payments. Be prepared to pay the appraisal fee in advance, which could be several hundred dollars, depending on the lender.
- When to get started: Before applying for a home equity loan, you should fine-tune your renovation cost estimates. Be flexible: You won’t know how much you can borrow until the lender appraises your home.
- How to get started: Once you know how much you need to borrow, you can compare lenders. Once you have selected a lender, submit an application and follow the steps they outline to complete the process.

- Home equity lines of credit
- A home equity line of credit (HELOC) is a revolving line of credit secured by the equity in your home, which acts as collateral. HELOCs work like credit cards: You can take money out for home-related expenses as needed. You will only make payments on the amount you use. Rates are usually variable.
- Who it’s best for: HELOCs are best for people doing larger home improvement projects who don’t need all the funds at once. A line of credit allows you to take out what you need when you need it and is ideal for projects that require flexibility.
- What to watch out for: Make sure you understand how the HELOC terms work, especially the initial “draw” period, which is the number of years you can use and re-use the credit. After the draw period ends, you must repay the balance for the remaining term in monthly installments. Like a home equity loan, your home secures a HELOC. You could lose your home if you do not make payments.
- When to get started: Getting a HELOC typically requires a home appraisal, so it is a good idea to apply for the loan before you begin your home improvement project.
- How to get started: Start by comparing lenders and finding the ones that meet your needs. Many local banks and credit unions offer HELOC rate discounts if you already have an account. Once you know what rates and terms you qualify for, choose a lender and apply.

- Cash-out refinancing involves replacing your existing mortgage with a larger one. You receive the difference between what you previously owed and your new loan amount in a lump sum. As with home equity loans, you’re using your equity to remodel your home. Rates are fixed.
- What to watch out for: A cash-out refinance may not be worth it if you secured your current rate before 2023. Inflation and Fed rate hikes pushed mortgage rates to decade highs, and recent Fed rate cuts haven't done much to lower them. Additionally, you’ll reduce your equity in the home by increasing the amount you owe relative to its value. Most lenders let you borrow up to 80 percent of the value of your home.
- When to get started: Cash-out refinancing requires an appraisal and the full lending process may take up to 60 days. Start the process well before your home improvements are due to begin.
- How to get started: Compare at least three mortgage lenders to see available rates. Bankrate’s experts advise against opting for a cash-out refinance if it means taking on a higher interest rate than you currently have.

- How to get started: After assessing whether you qualify, begin your search with FHA-approved lenders, which include banks, credit unions and online lenders. Compare rates offered by each lender and make sure to consider closing costs and other fees.

- Conventional renovation loans
- If you want to make some luxury upgrades like a custom pool or high-end countertops, conventional renovation loans like the Fannie Mae HomeStyle Renovation or Freddie Mac ChoiceRenovation loan may be a better option.
- Who it's best for: Borrowers with excellent credit who want to buy or refinance a home and roll the cost of improvements into the loan. One significant advantage of this option is that mortgage insurance is much cheaper than it is for FHA 203(k) loans. You can also finance major projects typically beyond the scope of what the 203(k) offers.
- What to watch out for: You'll need a higher credit score to qualify for conventional renovation loans, and are limited to a lower percentage of the after-improved value of your home. You'll also need to plan ahead with your contractors since you don't receive all of your funds at once. Instead, the fund is disbursed as your home is completed, like a construction loan.
- To determine your best loan option, compare the characteristics and drawbacks of each type of funding with your own needs and circumstances. For example, if you urgently need to replace your roof following a storm, you might need the fast timeline and large amount a personal loan can provide. When you’re ready, follow these steps to apply for a home improvement loan.
- Shop around for rates: After you’ve chosen a loan type, research lenders offering it. Make sure the lenders you are interested in serve borrowers with your credit profile and offer the loan amounts and term lengths you want.
- Gather documentation: Lenders have similar documentation requirements. Most will want to see your photo ID, proof of income and proof of residence. You may also need to provide information on your housing payment and any current debts you have.
- Online lender: Online lenders may offer lower interest rates than other lending institutions. The offers may also be easier to compare since the application process is completed online. The applications are typically completed within minutes, but this depends on the lender. However, if your credit isn't where you want it to be, then starting with a peer-to-peer lender may be better for you.
- Peer-to-peer lender: Peer-to-peer lenders may offer lower rates than online lenders and are most likely to approve borrowers with a shaky credit profile. Keep in mind that while this option boasts low rates, it can also mean slow funding or high origination fees.
- Frequently asked questions about home improvement loans
- How much can you borrow with a home improvement loan?
- Because home improvements do not use your home as collateral, you're not limited by the equity you have in your home. The individual lender determines the amount you can borrow. Most lenders offer loan amounts from $1,000 to $50,000, though some let you borrow up to $100,000.

- A home improvement loan may be the right choice if you qualify for competitive terms and the improvements you are making will increase your home's value or your quality of life. These loans offer advantages, like quick funding and flexible repayment options.
- But it's important to weigh the cost of borrowing against your project's return on investment (ROI). Home improvement loans can come with high fees and high interest rates, and like any loan, they increase your debt load. In some cases, it may be better to save and pay cash.

- Are home improvement loans tax-deductible?
- Personal loans for home improvement are not tax deductible because they're not secured by your home. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit, on the other hand, use your home as collateral for the loan. Because of this, you may be able to deduct the interest paid on a home equity loan or HELOC if the funds were used to "buy, build or substantially improve" the home used as collateral.

Financial Tips:
- Multiple discounts
- Limited loan amounts
- High minimum credit score
- No joint applications
- You must be at least 18 years of age (21 years of age in Puerto Rico). Co-applicants are not permitted. Existing Citi deposit and credit card customers who have been a Citi customer for less than 12 months are not eligible for a Citi® Personal Loan.
- If you apply online, you must agree to receive the loan note and all other account disclosures provided with your loan origination in an electronic format and provide your signature electronically.
- Rates as of 12-01-2024. Your APR may be as low as 11.49% or as high as 20.49% for the term of your loan. The lowest rate quoted assumes excellent credit and a loan term of 24 or 36 months. Your APR will depend on a variety of factors including your creditworthiness, term of loan, and existing relationship with Citi. Citi offers personal loans with a period of repayment between 12 and 60-month terms. For example, if you borrow $10,000 for 36 months at 15.99% APR, to repay your loan you will have to make 36 monthly payments of approximately $351.52.
- There is a 0.5% APR discount if you enroll in automatic payments at loan origination. Additionally, existing Citigold and Citi Priority customers will receive a 0.25% discount to the APR. If you are in default, your APR may increase by 2.00%. Rates subject to change without notice.
- Personal loans made through Upgrade feature Annual Percentage Rates (APRs) of 7.99%-35.99%. All personal loans have a 1.85% to 9.99% origination fee, which is deducted from the loan proceeds. Lowest rates require Autopay and paying off a portion of existing debt directly. Loans feature repayment terms of 24 to 84 months. For example, if you receive a $10,000 loan with a 36-month term and a 17.59% APR (which includes a 13.94% yearly interest rate and a 5% one-time origination fee), you would receive $9,500 in your account and would have a required monthly payment of $341.48. Over the life of the loan, your payments would total $12,293.46. The APR on your loan may be higher or lower and your loan offers may not have multiple term lengths available. Actual rate depends on credit score, credit usage history, loan term, and other factors. Late payments or subsequent charges and fees may increase the cost of your fixed rate loan. There is no fee or penalty for repaying a loan early. Personal loans issued by Upgrade's bank partners. Information on Upgrade's bank partners can be found at https://www.upgrade.com/bank-partners/.

- When to get started: Make sure your credit score is in tip-top shape, and you have all of your contractor information handy. Your project and builder will need to be approved before you can get any funds. Expect a more involved project and higher rates than you'd pay with a regular conventional loan.
- How to get started: You may need to hunt around for lenders experienced with renovation loans. Many mortgage banking companies have designated renovation loan teams with the extra expertise needed to guide you to a smooth renovation loan experience.

- "It’s important to understand the revolving credit feature of a HELOC only lasts for a set time – usually no more than 10 years. After that time, the entire balance is repaid on a fixed schedule for the remaining loan term. That can shock people who made interest-only payments during the revolving period. The other drawback is HELOC rates are usually variable, which may make the payment unaffordable if the Fed is hiking rates regularly."

- How to get a home improvement loan
- Get prequalified: If the lenders you’re considering offer prequalification, it’s a great way to compare possible rates and monthly payments without hurting your credit score. Prequalify for multiple lenders at once and look for the best deal.
- Fill out your application: After you’ve chosen a lender, complete a full application. Check the information you provide thoroughly to avoid mistakes. Most lenders do a hard credit check when you complete a formal application, so if you’re applying to more than one, keep your applications within a 14-day period to limit damage to your credit score.
- Where to get a home improvement loan
- You can get home improvement loans from the same institutions as you would a personal loan. This includes most banks, online lenders, credit unions and peer-to-peer lenders.
- Bank or credit union: If you have good credit and a solid repayment history, then start with your bank or credit union to see what rate you're offered. Plus, banks often give preexisting customers exclusive benefits for borrowing with them again, like extended grace periods or interest rate reductions. If the rates aren't ideal, turn to an online lender.

Financial Tips:
- A Bankrate staff member reported that opening a Bread Savings account was easy, taking them less than 10 minutes. The main reason for opening the account was the high annual percentage yield (APY) and no fees for withdrawals. While making their initial deposit while opening the account was easy, the staff member reported making additional deposits was difficult, requiring them to log into various bank accounts multiple times.

- Switching from an account earning a nominal yield, a Bankrate staff member opened an EverBank Performance Savings account for its stellar annual percentage yield (APY) and lack of fees. “We have a big chunk of money in savings because we hope to buy a house once mortgage rates drop,” said the staff member. “But we want that money to be earning money for us, instead of sitting there losing value due to inflation.”

- CIT Bank is known for offering multiple savings accounts. CIT Bank’s Platinum Savings account earns the highest yield on balances of $5,000 or more, while the Savings Connect account can be opened with just $100. These accounts don't charge a monthly maintenance fee. CIT Bank also has most of the other bank accounts a person could need, including a checking account, a money market account and CDs.

TAB Bank’s High Yield Savings Account doesn’t require a minimum opening deposit and doesn’t have a monthly maintenance fee. TAB Bank pays the same yield on any balance. (But of course, you’ll want to make sure that you’re within FDIC insurance limits and guidelines.)

- Although it is not a formal review site, Reddit’s geographical, personal finance and insurance forums generate discussion about specific insurance companies, Kin among them. The Reddit reviews skewed more negatively, with many customers complaining of being lured in with a low rate only to be hit with a steep raise when their policy was renewed. But, other users liked Kin’s easy signup system and customer service.

Application Process:
- At the same time, Kin also uses technology to monitor homes in the path of storms and pinpoint houses that may have sustained damage.

- Bankrate Scores
- Our Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impacts policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. Each factor was added to a category, and these categories were weighted in a tiered approach to analyze how companies perform in key customer-impacting categories.
- Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
- Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
- In May 2024, Bankrate collaborated with market research firm SliceMR to survey over 1,500 insurance customers nationwide, asking policyholders to rate their insurer’s cost, coverage, customer support and overall experience on a five-point scale. Bankrate and SliceMR collected and analyzed these customer ratings, along with website analytics and responses to three open-ended questions regarding customer experience. Responses are based on individual policyholders’ policy details and personal experience, and therefore cannot be verified for accuracy. Users received an incentive for their feedback. All ratings are unedited and have not been reviewed or approved by insurance carriers. User-generated ratings are separate from carrier Bankrate Scores — which are calculated based on our proprietary methodology — and may not match.

Financial Tips:
- Kin earned a 3.2 out of a possible 5 Bankrate Score. Its strong discount availability and user-friendly website helped boost its rating, but Kin lost some points for its limited state availability and customer service hours. While claims may be filed 24/7, general customer service hours are more restricted. Plus, Kin does not offer auto insurance, which could deter customers looking to bundle and manage multiple policies in one place.
- Third-party insurance ratings can be helpful when deciding between companies, and there are a couple of key ones to take note of. J.D. Power is a consumer data and analytics company that publishes customer satisfaction surveys for the insurance industry (among other industries). For home insurance, J.D. Power scores each company for overall claims and customer satisfaction. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) keeps track of the number of formal complaints filed against an insurance company and assigns each company an index. A score of 1.00 indicates that a company received an average number of complaints expected for a company its size, while a higher index indicates that a company received more complaints (and vice versa).
- Because Kin is a smaller insurance company, it was not included in the J.D Power 2024 Home Insurance Study or the 2024 Property Claims Satisfaction Study. AM Best similarly doesn’t rate Kin Interinsurance Network or Kin Interinsurance Nexus Exchange for financial strength. Demotech — another financial strength rating company — gives Kin Interinsurance Network and Kin Interinsurance Nexus Exchange an A (Exceptional) financial stability rating. This rating indicates that Kin has historically been considered reliable in regard to paying claims and remaining financially solvent. Given that the insurer specializes in high-risk properties that are likely to be hit with natural disaster damage, this score is important. After a flood or hurricane, an insurance company may be hit with thousands of claims at once.
- Between 2021 and 2023, Kin’s NAIC company complaint index has risen significantly. In 2021 the company’s homeowner complaint index was 0.35 and in 2022 it was 0.81. These scores are both below the National Complaint Index of 1.00. However, in 2023 the complaint index shot up to 1.55, meaning it received more complaints than it should have given its market share of insurance products. Kin’s complaint index across all products also went up exponentially between 2022 and 2023. Its complaint index was 2.33 in 2022 but nearly doubled to 4.65 in 2023.
- House & Property insurance: This offering provides a flexible policy that can be used for multiple purposes. Kin’s policy can be used for your home whether you live in it full-time, use it as a secondary home or rent the property out to others. The House & Property insurance policy can handle any combination of these situations with one plan.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/how-to-buy-a-house


Application Process:
- Whatever the economic state of the real estate market, buying a house can be an exciting and emotional process. Before starting your search, be sure you understand the ins and outs of homebuying, so you can make the best decisions for your family — and your wallet. Here’s what to know when buying a house, one step at a time.
- Buying a house: A step-by-step guide
- 2. Check your credit score
- Your credit score will help you determine your financing options; lenders use it (among other factors) to set the terms and rates of your loan. The higher your score, the lower the interest rate you will be eligible for — lower credit scores equate to more expensive mortgages.
- Get started: You can get your credit report and score from each of the three major credit reporting agencies, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion, for free once a year. Your bank or credit card company might offer free access to your score or credit report, too. If you discover any discrepancies, contact each agency and report the error.
- • Consider how different credit score ranges impact your interest rate, monthly payments and total interest.
- • Pull your credit reports from each of the credit bureaus for free every 12 months at AnnualCreditReport.com.
- • Learn other ways to get your free credit report and score.
- To avoid having to pay private mortgage insurance, or PMI, you’ll need to put down at least 20 percent of the home’s purchase price for a down payment. Some lenders offer mortgages without PMI with lower down payments, but expect to pay a higher interest rate. And be sure to do your research: Many types of loans require a much lower minimum down payment, and there are many government programs to help cover down payment costs for qualified buyers. Shop around carefully based on how much you’re able to pay upfront.
- Get started: Research the requirements for the loan you want so you know exactly how much you’ll need to save for a down payment. If a friend, relative or employer has offered to provide a down payment gift, initiate a conversation early on to learn how much they plan to contribute and if there’s any shortfall you’ll need to cover — and secure a gift letter from them well in advance.
- • Consider options offered by the federal government. If you qualify for an FHA, VA or USDA loan, your down payment minimum will be considerably lower than 20 percent.
- • Conventional loans offered by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, meanwhile, require just 3 percent down.
- • Look into local and state down payment assistance programs to see if you’re eligible for a cost-saving loan or grant.
- Get started: Carefully consider other expenses to determine what you can afford long-term. “Buyers tend to forget to factor in other costs, like homeowners association fees and maintenance,” says Paige Kruger, Realtor and founder of Signal Real Estate in Jacksonville Beach, Florida. “Just because you can afford a mortgage and a down payment doesn’t mean you can afford those long-term costs after you move.”
- • Determine the maximum loan you qualify for. Getting preapproved can help (see Step 5).
- • Analyze your monthly budget to make sure you can handle mortgage payments along with your other day-to-day bills.
- 5. Shop for a mortgage
- Getting preapproved for a mortgage gives you a firmer handle on how much you can afford, and it’s helpful when you make an offer on a house because it shows sellers you’re financially qualified. Once you’re ready to apply for official approval, you’re not obligated to stick with the same lender that issued your preapproval — compare the terms and rates offered by several companies.
- Get started: Shop around with at least three lenders or a mortgage broker to increase your chances of getting a low interest rate.
- • Work with an experienced mortgage lender who can walk you through all the options you’re eligible for.
- • Your lender should be able to guide you through each option’s overall costs as well.
- An experienced agent can save you time and money by helping you find the right home and negotiating with the seller on your behalf. Agents are licensed professionals who know their markets well and can guide you through your homebuying journey.
- Get started: Contact several local agents and talk with them about your needs before choosing one. “Someone with knowledge of an area can tell if your budget is realistic or not, depending on the features you desire in a home,” Kruger says. “They can also point you to adjacent areas in your desired neighborhood or other considerations to help you find a house.”
- Get started: Be specific with your agent about exactly what you want, so they can more effectively find options that meet your criteria. And keep an open mind: You may not be able to check off everything on your wish list, so prioritize must-haves over things that are nice to have but not crucial.
- Get started: Once you find “the one,” your agent will help you prepare a complete offer package, including your offer price, your preapproval letter, proof of funds for a down payment (this helps in competitive markets) and terms or contingencies.
- 10. Negotiate repairs and credits
- Your home inspection may reveal a few issues, especially if it’s an older home. Major problems might need to be dealt with before your mortgage lender will finalize your loan, and it’s common to negotiate for the seller to either pay for the repair or offer the buyer a credit to cover the cost.
- • Hazardous problems like structural damage or improper electrical wiring could keep your lender from approving your loan, so take the solutions very seriously.
- A preapproval is not the same thing as official approval. Getting final loan approval means you need to keep your finances and credit in line during the underwriting process. Don’t open new credit lines or make any major purchases until the paperwork is signed, and avoid changing jobs before closing too, if possible.
- Get started: Respond promptly to requests or questions from the lender, and double-check your loan estimate to ensure all the details are correct. You may need to submit additional paperwork as your lender completes the process, such as bank statements, tax returns or additional proof of income, so keep your paperwork organized.
- • Being preapproved doesn’t mean you’re officially in the clear — that’s not the case until a lender has given your loan the final stamp of approval.
- • Keep your finances and credit in good shape from preapproval until closing day.
- • Avoid running up credit cards, taking out new loans or closing old credit accounts. All these things can hurt your credit score or impact your debt-to-income ratio, which can imperil your final loan approval.
- Once all contingencies have been met, you’re happy with the final walk-through and your lender has declared your loan “clear to close,” it’s finally time to make it official and close on your new home. After all of the paperwork has been signed, the home is officially yours and you’ll get the keys. Congratulations!
- Get started: Three business days before your closing date, the lender will provide you with a closing disclosure that outlines your loan details, such as the monthly payment, loan type and term, interest rate, loan fees and how much money you must bring to closing. You will attend the closing along with your real estate agent, possibly the seller and their agent, and the closing agent, who may be a representative from the escrow or title company or a real estate attorney. This is also when you’ll wire your closing costs and down payment, depending on the escrow company’s procedures.
- • When you get your closing disclosure, compare it to your loan estimate to ensure the terms are the same. Ask any questions and correct any errors before you sign the paperwork.
- Today’s combination of elevated mortgage rates and high home prices has plenty of people wondering whether they should try to buy a home now, or wait for things to settle down. Traditionally, spring is the start of the homebuying season, with many listings hitting the market and activity peaking over late spring/early summer. However, trying to time the market is risky, and your own financial readiness is more important than the time of year.
- The answer likely depends on your finances and life circumstances more than the condition of the housing market. If you’re financially stable, you have enough in savings to cover the down payment and other expenses, your employment and income are secure, and you’re ready to stay in one place for a while, then now is a perfectly fine time to buy a house. You can always refinance if rates drop significantly. On the other hand, if your savings are tight or your credit score is less than stellar, it might make more sense to take time to build those before buying.
- When budgeting for your monthly housing costs, factor in not only the principal and interest amounts of your mortgage payment, but also property taxes, home insurance premiums and homeowners association fees (if applicable), plus private mortgage insurance if you’re putting down less than 20 percent. And don’t forget to set aside money for ongoing maintenance and unexpected repairs, too.
- What is a good credit score to buy a house?
- There is no hard and fast answer, but the minimum score needed to qualify for most conventional loans is 620. There are options that have much lower requirements, however, the higher your credit score, the better rate you’re likely to qualify for. In fact, according to third quarter 2024 data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, two-thirds of newly originated mortgage loans went to borrowers with credit scores of 760 or higher.

Application Process:
- A savings account is a safe place to keep your emergency fund or set aside money for short-term financial goals. These accounts are offered by almost every bank and credit union in the U.S., and they can help you grow your savings through the interest they pay.
- It’s relatively easy to open a savings account at most banks and credit unions, although it usually takes several steps.
- Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) or National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) insurance coverage
- Your savings account also should mesh with your priorities and goals, says Mary Hines Droesch, Head of Product for Consumer and Small Business Products at Bank of America. “Whether you’re saving for a home, education, a car, vacations, or an emergency fund. For example, if you’re working to build a savings habit, consider an account that automates the process for you,” said Droesch.
- You may need to lift a credit freeze if you have one in place before opening a new bank account.
- 4. Complete the application
- Complete your application with all of the required information and wait for the bank to approve your account. This usually happens quickly, from a matter of minutes to within a few business days.
- Albeit a big first step, opening a savings account is only the beginning of your savings journey. To make the most of your account, you’ll want to set up a savings plan. A couple of tips that may help you get started include:
- Most banks and credit unions let their customers do their banking online, and that includes opening a new account. When you go with a bank that doesn’t maintain any branches, you’ll probably be required to open the account online.
- Some banks charge a monthly maintenance fee unless you meet certain requirements. Typically, you can have the fee waived by making a minimum number of transactions per statement cycle, maintaining a balance above a set threshold or setting up direct deposit.
- It’s important to consider banks and credit unions that are insured up to the limit allowed by law. For banks, these will be accounts insured by the FDIC. For credit unions, these will be accounts insured by the NCUA.
- Both the FDIC and NCUA insure deposits up to $250,000 per depositor, per bank or credit union, per ownership category.
- Sometimes, a bank will deny a new savings account application. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including unpaid bank fees or a history of bouncing checks.
- Many banks use ChexSystems, a consumer reporting agency, when making approval decisions. If your bank uses ChexSystems and you’re denied an account, you can request a disclosure report to find out why. You can also dispute any errors you find that may be negatively impacting your report.

Financial Tips:
- Some banks offer multiple savings accounts. If you’re considering a bank that offers more than one option, compare them using the criteria above, and look out for any distinguishing features unique to each account.

- Frequently asked questions about business loans
- How hard is it to get a business loan?
- Caret DownHow hard it is to get a business loan depends on the type of business loan, the lender and your business’s qualifications when applying.  For example, most SBA business loans have strict qualification requirements. But merchant cash advances, invoice factoring and invoice financing are often easier for applicants with poor credit but come with higher interest rates and likely shorter repayment terms.
- How hard is it to get a business loan?
- How do I take out a business loan for the first time?
- Caret DownTo take out your first business loan, you first want to research different types of business loans that fit the purpose for your funding. You’ll also want to determine how much funding you need and how much you can afford. You can use a business loan calculator to estimate monthly payments on a loan. Next, you’ll need to research lenders and, if possible, prequalify with several to see what loan, interest rates, fees and terms you qualify for. Then, compare loan options and apply for your preferred business loan.
- How do I take out a business loan for the first time?
- How much collateral is needed for a business loan?
- Caret DownTypically, lenders require that the collateral used to secure the loan equals to 100 percent of the loan amount. If you take out a secured business loan, the value of your collateral should equal the amount you plan to borrow.

Application Process:
- If you have a new business or are ready to take your business to the next level, a small business loan might be your next step. Small business loans work by giving you a lump sum of cash that you then repay with interest over a set time period.
- Small businesses have access to many loan options from a variety of sources, and each type works slightly differently and can go toward different purchases. Before you sign for a loan, it’s important to research different types of loans and lenders to make the best decision for your business.
- Learn more about how small business loans work and the different types of loans to help you choose the right option.
- How do small business loans work?
- Small business loans work by borrowing money from a lender and then repaying the amount borrowed over a set period, including interest and fees. You can use the loan for a variety of purposes in your business, including to cover operational costs, buy equipment, stock up on inventory or hire employees.
- Businesses considering a small business loan can choose between secured and unsecured business loans. A secured loan requires you to put down collateral, while an unsecured loan does not. Loan collateral might be equipment, real estate or other business assets used to back the loan. If the borrower fails to repay or defaults on the loan, the lender can take possession of the collateral to cover the borrowed amount.
- While unsecured loans don’t require collateral, they often require a personal guarantee, meaning you and other business owners pledge personal responsibility for repaying the debt.
- Here’s a closer look at how a few popular types of business loans work.
- How do term loans work?
- Term loans provide a lump sum of cash that is paid back over a set period of time. The terms can be short, limiting terms to 24 months or less, or long allowing you to pay back the loan in up to 10 or more years. Short-term loans help you pay off the loan quickly, while long-term loans offer lower monthly payments that stretch out the cost of the loan over a long time.
- Typically long-term loans are reserved for borrowers with strong credit and finances because these borrowers are likely to repay the loan in full. Keep in mind that the longer your term, the more you pay in interest over that term.
- How do SBA loans work?
- SBA loans are business loans that are partially guaranteed by the U.S. Small Business Administration. These loans are known for having low rates and long repayment periods, making them a particularly affordable borrowing option. But they can take 30 to 90 days to receive and have strict qualification requirements. Often, these loans require a good credit score and solid business revenue.
- For example, many lenders like Live Oak Bank require a solid credit score of at least 650 to apply for its SBA loans. But there are some lenders that lower credit requirements, such as Creditfy that requires only a 600 credit score for SBA loans.
- To get an SBA loan, you apply through an SBA-approved lender. This will require extensive documentation, including personal and business financial statements, a business plan and SBA-specific forms, such as SBA Form 413. Most SBA loans also require a down payment and personal guarantees.
- How do business lines of credit work?
- Business lines of credit offer a flexible borrowing option that the business owner can reuse as needed, much like a business credit card. The lender sets a credit limit, which is the maximum amount the business owner can borrow.
- You can then draw from the credit limit when you need the funds, only paying interest on the amount borrowed. As you pay back the loan, the credit limit refreshes, allowing you to borrow more funds in the future.
- Funds from a business line of credit can be made available relatively quickly, often within a business day, when working with an online lender. The money can cover business expenses, such as paying employees or purchasing inventory. But lines of credit typically come with smaller funding limits than traditional business loans, so they may not be able to cover significant expenses or funding needs.
- You may also pay higher interest rates on a line of credit than other types of loans. Rates can start at 8 percent but may go up as much as 60 percent, depending on your creditworthiness.
- Invoice financing and invoice factoring are both short-term financing that use your unpaid invoices to secure the loan. With invoice financing, the accounts receivables are used to determine the amount of your advance, up to 90 percent of your invoices. Once your client pays the invoice, you must repay the lender for the money you borrowed. You will also pay any fees for the loan.
- Invoice factoring involves selling your business’s unpaid invoices to a third-party invoice factoring company. The factoring company advances you a portion of the invoices and then collects the invoices directly from the client. Once your client pays the invoice, the lender sends you the remaining amount after subtracting lending fees.
- Both invoice financing and factoring can be valuable options for business owners with bad credit or for startups that do not have much of a borrowing track record yet. They weigh your clients’ track record of payments more than considering your business’s credit score and finances. The downside to this level of accessibility is that these loans tend to cost more than term loans and lines of credit.
- A merchant cash advance (MCA) is an advance against your business’s future sales, specifically debit and credit card sales. The advance is provided in a lump sum of cash, which you repay with a percentage of your future sales, such as 10 percent or 20 percent. The lender will also take its fees from your future sales.
- MCAs are typically a short-term form of borrowing offered by online lenders. And often, you’ll pay a higher APR on cash advances than other types of business loans. It’s possible for interest rates to soar into the triple digits with MCAs, so business owners should proceed carefully before seeking out this type of business financing.
- Approval for MCAs may be possible with subprime credit, sometimes as low as 500. But to qualify, you’ll need to provide details about your business and its track record of income from credit and debit card sales.
- Types of small business loans
- How you plan to use your business loan impacts the type of small business loan you choose. For some business owners, the funds may be used to cover day-to-day operations, while others are interested in purchasing equipment or vehicles.

Financial Tips:
- A Bankrate staff member reported that opening a Bread Savings account was easy, taking them less than 10 minutes. The main reason for opening the account was the high annual percentage yield (APY) and no fees for withdrawals. While making their initial deposit while opening the account was easy, the staff member reported making additional deposits was difficult, requiring them to log into various bank accounts multiple times.

Eligibility Criteria:
- Assuming you have enough equity, you can get a home equity loan or HELOC by applying with a lender. Many banks provide home equity loans, and increasing numbers of online lenders do, too. To help narrow down your options, review home equity lender reviews and testimonials. Once you find a lender you like, check its eligibility requirements to make sure you qualify, especially as regards your credit score and debt-to-income ratio.
- How do I get a home equity loan or HELOC?
- “Mortgage Monitor report November 2024.” ICE Mortgage Technology. Accessed Feb. 10, 2025.
- “Mortgage Monitor report November 2024.” ICE Mortgage Technology. Accessed Feb. 10, 2025.
- HELOC and home equity loan requirements in 2025

Application Process:
- Subtract your mortgage balance. Once you know the value of your home, check your latest mortgage statement. Subtract the amount you still owe on your mortgage and any other debts secured by your home. The result is your home equity.
- Five years later, your home’s value has appreciated to about $440,000, and you still owe roughly $359,000 on your loan. At this point, you’d have $81,000 in equity ($440,000 – 359,000).
- As you make mortgage payments: Every month when you make your regular mortgage payment, you’re paying down your mortgage balance and increasing your home equity stake. You can also make additional mortgage principal payments to build your equity even faster.
- ICE Mortgage Monitor Report August 2024
- Home equity loan
- A home equity loan is a second mortgage for a fixed amount at a fixed interest rate. The amount you can borrow is based on the equity in your home, and you can use the funds for any purpose. This option can be ideal if you have a specific large expense or debt to pay off. It also comes with the stability of predictable monthly payments. If you use the funds to remodel your home, the interest might be tax-deductible.
- Home equity line of credit (HELOC)
- A home equity line of credit, or HELOC, is also secured by your property and works like a credit card, charging interest at a variable rate. You can withdraw as much as you want up to the credit limit during an initial draw period, usually up to 10 years; after that, withdrawals cease and you have to pay back what you’ve borrowed, plus interest. During the draw period, you can make repayments too, so that the credit line goes back up and you can withdraw again.
- Cash-out refinance
- A cash-out refinance replaces your current mortgage with another, bigger loan. This loan includes the balance you owe on the existing mortgage and a portion of your home’s equity, withdrawn as cash. You can use these funds for any purpose. Unlike a HELOC or home equity loan, a cash-out refi might allow you to get a lower rate on your main mortgage, depending on market conditions, and shorten the term so you can repay it sooner.
- Reverse mortgage
- A reverse mortgage is an option for homeowners aged  62 (or 55 with some products)  and up. Unlike a HELOC or a home equity loan, the money withdrawn using a reverse mortgage doesn’t have to be repaid in monthly installments. Instead, the lender pays you each month while you continue to live in the home. The loan, plus interest, must be repaid when the borrower dies, permanently vacates or sells the home.
- A shared equity agreement is a formal arrangement between a professional investor (or investment company) and a homeowner. You can receive a lump sum of cash in exchange for a percentage of ownership in your home and/or a portion of its future appreciation; the investor receives compensation when the agreement ends on a designated date, or when you sell the home. You make no monthly payments in the meantime. These agreements cater to credit-challenged borrowers or those experiencing financial obstacles that prevent them from securing a traditional loan.
- Why home equity loans are popular now
- The rapid rise in property values of the last few years has sent ownership stakes soaring. According to Corelogic’s Homeowner Equity Insights, in the third quarter of 2024, U.S. mortgage-holding homeowners saw their equity increase $425 billion in value year-over-year. For the average borrower, that’s a gain of $5,700 in their ownership stake.
- Also, mortgage rates have risen significantly since the pandemic years, which has impacted the cost of cash-out refinancing (previously, the most common way to tap home equity). Admittedly, HELOC and home equity loan rates have increased, as well; just above 8 percent currently, they aren’t the bargain they once were. Still, they are more affordable than other forms of financing, such as credit cards and personal loans, and can be a little easier and quicker to obtain than a refi. Plus, you won’t need to give up your low-rate mortgage, if you have one.
- Lower interest rates: Since your home is the collateral for a home equity loan or line of credit, they are considered less risky for the lender. These products also tend to offer better rates than unsecured credit cards or personal loans.
- Tax benefits: If you itemize deductions on your tax returns, you might be able to deduct the interest on home equity loans or lines of credit, provided the money is used to “buy, build or substantially improve” the home.
- Risk of losing your home: Home equity debt is secured by your home, so if you fail to make payments, your lender can foreclose. If home values drop, you could also wind up owing more on your home than it’s worth. That can make it more difficult to sell your home if you need to.
- Borrowing costs: Some lenders charge additional fees for home equity loans or HELOCs; you often have to pay closing costs as you would on a mortgage.
- Misusing the money: It’s best to use home equity to finance expenses that’ll serve as investments, like renovating a home to increase its value, starting a business or eliminating debt. Stick to needs versus wants; otherwise, you could be perpetuating a cycle of living beyond your means.
- This means avoiding spending the funds you pull from your home on luxury purchases/big-ticket items (especially things that depreciate, like cars), holiday shopping, vacations or other short-term or discretionary expenses. Nor is it a good idea to use equity to meet everyday expenses if your income is falling short. Covering an emergency or unexpected cost is ok, but not repeatedly or for a long time.
- What about educational expenses? It’s not the worst idea in the world, but investigate other financing first: The interest rate on a federal student loan is likely less than the rate on a home equity loan nowadays. Buying other property might be feasible, but again, check out mortgage rates on second homes before using an HELoan or HELOC.
- How fast your home builds equity depends on a number of factors. The easiest and most consistent way to build equity is by making your regular monthly mortgage payments. Each payment will build hundreds of dollars in equity. You can also build home equity if your home appreciates, but a rise in real estate property values is beyond an individual’s control.
- Most lenders allow you to borrow only a percentage of your home’s equity for a home equity loan or HELOC. The exact terms and percentage rates vary by lender, but it’s common for the maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio to be 80 percent or 85 percent of your home’s appraised value.
- Yes, you can use the proceeds of a home equity loan or HELOC for anything you want. Whether you should is another matter. In general, tapping home equity is better for major home renovations or other goals that will further your financial life, such as paying off debt.

- Bankrate Scores
- Our Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impacts policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. Each factor was added to a category, and these categories were weighted in a tiered approach to analyze how companies perform in key customer-impacting categories.
- Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
- Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.

- In May 2024, Bankrate collaborated with market research firm SliceMR to survey over 1,500 insurance customers nationwide, asking policyholders to rate their insurer’s cost, coverage, customer support and overall experience on a five-point scale. Bankrate and SliceMR collected and analyzed these customer ratings, along with website analytics and responses to three open-ended questions regarding customer experience. Responses are based on individual policyholders’ policy details and personal experience, and therefore cannot be verified for accuracy. Users received an incentive for their feedback. All ratings are unedited and have not been reviewed or approved by insurance carriers. User-generated ratings are separate from carrier Bankrate Scores — which are calculated based on our proprietary methodology — and may not match.

Financial Tips:
- Offers multiple reward options for safe driving, including deductible rewards and Drivewise; strong mobile and online tools for claims and policy management.
- In our Allstate insurance review, Allstate car insurance received a Bankrate Score of 3.9 out of 5.0 possible points. To find the best car insurance companies, our editorial team evaluated how well the auto insurance companies performed in a variety of categories, including policy options, discounts and third-party ratings from Standard & Poor’s, AM Best and J.D. Power, as well as mobile app accessibility and other attributes.
- Allstate’s Deductible Rewards program awards $100 off the collision deductible for every year of safe driving, up to $500. Allstate’s Safe Driving Bonus also allows drivers to earn cash back or credit to their car insurance policy for every six months without an accident. For those who want to be rewarded further for safe driving, Allstate offers Drivewise, a usage-based telematics program that provides savings for good driving habits and awards points for passing safe driving challenges.
- Multiple reward options, such as Deductible Rewards and Drivewise, for driving safely, though availability may vary by state laws
- Scored below average in a majority of regions based on J.D. Power’s 2023 U.S. Auto Insurance Study
- An insurance company’s customer satisfaction may be a priority for you, especially if you want reliable customer service. Looking to third-party rating agencies like J.D. Power could be useful. J.D. Power conducts annual surveys from existing customers about some of the largest insurance companies in the country. J.D. Power results are ranked on a 1,000-point scale, with a higher score indicating more overall customer satisfaction.
- When evaluating insurance companies, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Complaint Index is a valuable tool. The NAIC assigns a baseline score of 1.00 to represent the average number of complaints for companies of similar size. A score above 1.00 indicates more complaints than average, while a score below 1.00 suggests fewer complaints. The NAIC also differentiates complaint indexes based on product type, providing a clear view of customer satisfaction across different insurance products. Allstate has shown a trend of improving complaint index scores over the past few years for its private passenger products, consistently moving closer to or below the industry average.
- Lowering your car insurance premium could be achieved by comparing multiple insurers to find the best rate for your current circumstances, keeping your driving record clean and/or taking advantage of discounts. Allstate offers a healthy selection of discounts, many of them linked to how you choose to pay your premium. Some of Allstate’s less common discount opportunities include:

Financial Tips:
- Money tip:
- The most important thing to know with respect to credit card rate adjustments is that Federal Reserve rate changes (up or down) generally pass through to customers within a month or two. And these Fed rate changes affect new and existing credit card balances.
- How do credit card rates affect you?
- Most credit cards bill on a monthly cycle. If you pay your credit card purchases in full, you aren’t charged interest and you typically receive an interest-free grace period of at least 21 days. For example, if your billing statement is generated on the 1st of the month, you usually have until at least the 22nd of that month to pay without interest accruing. Depending on when you made the purchase, you might actually have close to two months without owing interest (if you bought something early in the billing cycle).
- However, if you carry a balance from one billing cycle to the next, it’s a completely different story. Credit card rates are usually expressed as APRs – annual percentage rates. But taking this a level deeper, what actually happens when you carry a balance is that the card issuer assesses a daily interest rate (typically the APR divided by the 365 days in a year) on your average daily balance during a given billing cycle. The most important thing for consumers to understand is that, when they carry balances, interest is accruing every single day (and usually at a hefty interest rate). That’s why it’s essential to pay down credit card debt as quickly as possible.
- Let’s say you have $5,000 of credit card debt and your interest rate is 20 percent APR. If you only make minimum payments, you will be in debt for about 23 years and you’ll end up paying about $7,723 in interest, according to Bankrate’s calculator.
- An interest-free grace period applies only to purchases. If you’ve made a balance transfer or taken a cash advance, different APRs could apply and there may not be any grace period for those transactions.
- What are the different types of credit card interest rates?
- Thus far, we’ve focused on purchase APRs. But credit cards often have other interest rates for different types of transactions. Here are some common examples:
- Balance Transfer APR: The interest rate you owe on balances transferred from loans or other credit cards to the applicable credit card. For many cards, you begin with a low rate (even 0 percent) for a specified number of months before transitioning to the regular APR.
- Introductory APR: This is an incentive offered by credit card companies to new applicants to give an especially-low rate for a certain time period once an account has been opened. This rate, often an introductory 0 percent APR, is consistently lower than the typical APR for each card.
- Cash Advance APR: This rate is applied when withdrawing money from an ATM or bank using your credit card.
- When we refer to the average credit card rate, we mean the average midpoint of the APR ranges assessed by 111 popular credit cards offered by the 50 largest U.S.-based credit card issuers. Most credit cards charge different interest rates to different customers based upon their creditworthiness. A consumer with an excellent credit score, for example, might be charged 14.99 percent. That same card might charge as high as, say, 24.99 percent to someone with a lower credit score. In that example, we would use 19.99 percent (the midpoint between 14.99 percent and 24.99 percent) in our average credit card rate calculations.

Financial Tips:
- The Chase Sapphire Preferred is an excellent entry point into the world of travel rewards since it offers impressive value, multiple redemption options and premium benefits for a modest $95 annual fee.
- A FICO score/credit score is used to represent the creditworthiness of a person and may be one indicator to the credit type you are eligible for. However, credit score alone does not guarantee or imply approval for any financial product.
- Bankrate collects scores from real cardholders to create these ratings. Cardholders are not offered any incentives, and credit card issuers do not have any say in how ratings are calculated or displayed.
- Bankrate score
- Our writers, editors and industry experts score credit cards based on a variety of factors including card features, bonus offers and independent research. Credit card issuers have no say or influence on how we rate cards.
- The Chase Sapphire Preferred Card is one of the best travel credit cards on the market. It has a relatively low annual fee, a generous rewards program and top-tier travel protections. Boasting various travel and everyday rewards categories, stellar redemption value, annual credits through Chase Travel℠ and an anniversary points bonus, the Sapphire Preferred offers significant value to everyday spenders and rewards experts alike.
- Credit Card Cash Back Icon
- 5X points on travel purchased through Chase Travel℠ (excluding hotel purchases that qualify for the $50 annual hotel credit)

- This card packs phenomenal redemption value through its impressive airline and hotel transfer partners, statement credits and 25 percent point value redemption boost toward Chase Travel.
- The Sapphire Preferred is hard to beat if you’re looking for a cost-effective travel card. Its travel perks, annual credits and bonus points are impressive for a card in its class and can easily justify the annual fee. Perhaps even more appealing is the diverse selection of bonus categories and redemption options, plus the remarkably high redemption values that can fuel your next trip.
- With the Chase Sapphire Preferred current welcome offer, new cardholders can earn 60,000 bonus points after spending $4,000 on purchases in the first three months from account opening. According to Bankrate's valuations, those points can be worth around $1,200 at a value of 2.0 cents per point per point on average when transferred to the right travel partners. While a downgrade from its previous welcome offer, which offered up to $300 in statement credits on Chase Travel purchases in the first year in addition to 60,000 bonus points, this offer still adds exceptional first-year value to this card.
- Even this card’s non-travel redemptions can provide value and versatility. You can redeem Chase Ultimate Rewards points at 1 cent apiece for cash back, statement credits, gift cards, merchandise (including Apple product purchases), Chase Experience events and Chase Dining purchases. You can also use your points at the checkout screen on Amazon.com and PayPal for a lower value (0.8 cents apiece). There’s no cap on the number of points you can receive, and points never expire, so the Sapphire Preferred has solid potential as your primary credit card.
- Two of the most valuable perks of the Sapphire Preferred are its recurring bonuses. You’ll get up to $50 back each year in statement credits for hotel stays you purchase through Chase Travel. You’ll also get an eye-catching 10 percent points bonus on your total combined spending from the previous year, automatically added to your rewards balance each account anniversary. For example, if you spend $30,000 in a calendar year, you will earn 3,000 additional bonus points. These two yearly benefits can nearly offset the annual fee before factoring in your rewards spending.
- Chase also stacks on additional, limited-time partner perks so that your first few years with the card are especially lucrative. Although these partner perks won’t last forever, you can also rack up statement credits and bonus points from the Sapphire Preferred’s Lyft and DoorDash benefits that could be worth close to $200 or more.
- The Sapphire Preferred has a $95 annual fee, which may appear intimidating if you only travel occasionally and you’re looking for your first travel card. However, this price tag is low compared to the perks and rewards the card offers. The annual account anniversary bonus points and credits can potentially offset the annual fee alone, but the fee also isn’t too difficult to offset through your standard rewards spending.
- The rewards and perks value can be difficult to find among no-annual-fee travel cards, so the Sapphire Preferred card's annual fee can be well worth it. No-annual-fee competitors also typically have lower rewards rates than the Preferred card and no yearly credits or notable travel perks.
- The other rates and fees are typical for travel cards — there are no foreign transaction fees to worry about while you’re abroad, and the ongoing APR is only slightly higher than the average current credit card interest rate.

- We rate credit cards using a proprietary card scoring system that ranks each card’s estimated average rewards rate, estimated annual earnings, welcome bonus value, APR, fees, perks and more against those of other cards in its primary category.

- To start, each rewards or cash back card is scored based on whether it offers an intro APR and how its ongoing APR compares to the rates available on other rewards or cash back cards.
- We also score each card based on how its annual fee influences its overall value.
- We consider a card’s annual fee in two ways — how it ranks relative to the fees you’ll find on other cards in the category and how it impacts a card’s overall rewards value. Cards with an annual fee will always be at a slight disadvantage in our scoring system since annual fees inherently cut into your rewards value, but if a card offers terrific value via its ongoing rewards and perks, it can earn a high score even if it carries a high annual fee.
- With this in mind, we rate a card based primarily on how its ongoing rewards value and ongoing perk value (such as annual credits or bonuses) stack up against other cards in the category when you subtract its annual fee.

Application Process:
- When considering a personal loan, check average interest rates as a starting point. Your credit score, the type of lender you choose, and even your location can all impact the rate you ultimately qualify for. Always compare rates from multiple lenders, and take steps to improve your credit score to get the best possible interest rate.

Financial Tips:
- To find the best deal, compare your bank or credit union’s offerings with any online lenders you may be familiar with and prequalify with multiple lenders if possible.
- Average personal loan interest rates by online lender
- Average personal loan interest rates by banks
- Average personal loan interest rates by credit union
- Other factors that affect your personal loan rate
- Your credit score plays the biggest role in the personal loan interest rate you can qualify for. Lenders consider other details to gauge your creditworthiness and, by extension, features you may qualify for. The factors evaluated often include:
- Your income. Some lenders offer discounted rates for high incomes. You’ll need to earn significantly more than the average person to qualify for the highest personal loan amounts.
- Your debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Lenders measure how much of your current income is put toward debt. A low DTI ratio may get you a lower APR.
- Your loan term. You’ll typically get a lower rate for a shorter term. However, a short term equals a higher monthly cost, so check your budget to ensure the payment is affordable.
- Your loan amount. Some lenders offer lower rates for more significant loan amounts. The other side is also true — you may have to pay higher rates for smaller amounts.
- Your banking relationship. Banks and credit unions may offer discounts if you also have a checking account with them.
- Your employment history. Because personal loans are unsecured, lenders deep dive into your work history to make sure your work has been stable with regular earnings.
- When you apply for a personal loan you can expect to provide documentation, including:
- Income verification, like pay stubs and bank statements.
- Why different lenders charge different personal loan rates
- Personal loan companies set their rates based on the kind of borrowers they want to lend to. You’ll often find much lower rates at online lenders that cater to high-earning, excellent credit borrowers.
- Banks and credit unions may offer lower rates to their existing customers, especially if they have significant balances in deposit accounts like checking and savings. That means you should still shop around for low rates if you have fair or bad credit.
- Bad credit lender rates can vary significantly, and some may approve you based on other factors like how long you’ve worked at your job or what type of work you do. Lenders that offer terms shorter than the 24-month standard may also offer rock-bottom rates if you qualify for the higher monthly payment.
- How are average personal loan interest rates trending?
- Average personal loan rates began rising in March 2022 when the Fed announced its first of several rate hikes aimed at cooling off inflation. Despite forecasts for lower overall rates in 2024, average personal loan rates continued rising throughout the year’s first and second quarters, seemingly peaking in October.
- Unfortunately, even with Fed cuts in September, November and December, a weakening economy and the Fed’s caution around dropping rates further could keep consumer borrowing rates high. The central bank held the target interest rate steady in January 2025, signaling continued caution. Personal loans are more closely tied to the consumer’s health, and a soft economy could lead to unemployment or reduced worker hours, causing personal loan lenders to steady rates. Those with excellent credit may see rates drop slightly regardless.

- Yields on many deposit accounts at banks and credit unions began to pull back in late 2024 after the Fed began cutting rates last September as a result of the inflation dropping to 2.4 percent. That’s because yields on some deposit accounts, including savings accounts, tend to move in the same direction as the Fed’s benchmark rate.

- Will a checking account build or hurt credit?
- The short answer is that a checking account won't hurt your credit, with a couple of exceptions. Banks might check your credit report when you open a checking account, but this is considered a "soft inquiry," which will not affect your credit score. If you sign up for overdraft protection, however, this results in a "hard inquiry," which might dock your score. That's because overdraft protection is considered a line of credit, much like a credit card.
- The credit bureaus may ignore your banking behavior, but it is being closely monitored by such companies as ChexSystems, a national consumer reporting agency that provides banks with reports about any blemishes on an account applicant's banking history. A record of bounced checks, unpaid fees and other slip-ups can make it difficult to get approved.

Banks might check your credit report when you open a checking account, but this is considered a "soft inquiry," which will not affect your credit score. If you sign up for overdraft protection, however, this results in a "hard inquiry," which might dock your score. That's because overdraft protection is considered a line of credit, much like a credit card.
- The credit bureaus may ignore your banking behavior, but it is being closely monitored by such companies as ChexSystems, a national consumer reporting agency that provides banks with reports about any blemishes on an account applicant's banking history. A record of bounced checks, unpaid fees and other slip-ups can make it difficult to get approved.

Application Process:
- January, 2024:  Called to get a mortgage.  SURE!  Said the first of like 15 people.  We can do that!  Ok.  Can you send us this obnoxious number of papers?  Sure!  Time to close!  Ohhhh.... wait.... we can't do that.

- Checkmark IconScores above average for customer service

- No USDA loans

- How Bankrate scored Rocket Mortgage
- Rocket Mortgage isn’t the most cost-friendly lender, and its APRs are often significantly higher than Bankrate averages. We score it 1.8 out of 5 stars for affordability.
- Interest rates: As of this review, Rocket Mortgage’s mortgage rates were well above market average, based on Bankrate data.
- Down payment: Rocket offers VA loans with zero percent down, FHA loans with 3.5 percent down and, with its Rocket ONE+ program, you can get a conventional loan with just 1 percent down.
- Closing costs: Rocket charges an origination fee, rate-lock fee and more. These fees, as well as other closing costs, vary by the particulars of your loan.
- Rocket Mortgage provides several different mortgage types to meet a range of borrower needs, and is available nationwide, awarding it 5 out of 5 stars for availability.
- Home loans offered: Rocket Mortgage offers conventional, USDA, jumbo, FHA and VA purchase and refinance options, as well as home equity loans. Notably, the lender’s Fresh Start program pairs borrowers who need help improving their credit with financial consultants.
- Footprint: Rocket works with borrowers across the U.S. It does not maintain branch locations.
- Where to find: You can apply for a mortgage with Rocket Mortgage online or by phone.
- To help you better understand what types of borrowers are interested in this lender, here’s more information about Bankrate users who submitted a form to this lender through our site.
- Borrower experience: 4.6/5
- It’s easy to get in touch with Rocket Mortgage if you need help, and the lender has a solid reputation for customer satisfaction. While you can see generic rate offers on its website, you’ll need to submit contact info for a personalized rate quote. This lowers Rocket’s score to 4.6 out of 5 stars for borrower experience.
- Preapproval and application process: Rocket Mortgage is the gold standard as far as application experience. If you have a regular W-2 job, every part of the application process can happen online (if you’re self-employed, you’ll need to connect with a human at some point). The lender has a mobile app that allows you to get preapproved, upload documents and e-sign from your phone.
- Transparency: Rocket Mortgage displays promotional rates on its website, which are updated daily. To get a rate tailored to you, however, you’ll need to submit your contact info.
- "When I last took a loan through Rocket in 2007, it had a fairly high-tech process for dealing with all the paperwork, showing you the status of your loan, etc. My biggest complaint with Rocket is that when I checked their rates in 2021 when I was looking to refi, their reps were really pushy following that initial rate check. They called/emailed me multiple times trying to get me to start the refi process, and it overall felt very like "used car sales" tactics. "
- Rocket Mortgage reputation
- While Rocket Mortgage does have its share of customer complaints, the lender ranks above-average for customer satisfaction in the mortgage industry, according to J.D. Power’s 2024 mortgage origination satisfaction study. The lender is accredited with the Better Business Bureau and has an A+ rating from the organization.
- What consumers say about Rocket Mortgage
- Rocket Mortgage has mixed reviews from borrowers on Bankrate. On one hand, some reviewers remark on the seamless experience, knowledgeable staff, solid customer service and easy-to-use tech. However, several reviewers find the company to be dishonest, incompetent and pushy.
- Compare Rocket Mortgage to other lenders

In the event more than one lender meets these standards, we suggest the one with the lowest APRs.

- Rocket Mortgage special offers
- When taking out a conventional loan, you’re required to put down at least 3 percent. If you’re eligible, Rocket’s ONE+ program lowers that minimum to just 1 percent, covering the remaining 2 percent through a grant. The program also covers private mortgage insurance (PMI) at no cost.
- Rocket credit card
- Rocket Mortgage’s Visa Signature Card offers a generous 5 percent back on all purchases, up to the limit, with the catch that the rewards are worth full value only if you ultimately get your home loan from Rocket Mortgage. That can discourage you from shopping around for a mortgage, a practice that could save you more money than the credit card’s cash back.
- The RocketRentRewards program provides a closing cost credit to renters: 10 percent of the last 12 months paid in rent — up to $5,000. Your rent payments must be verified with documentation.
- If you qualify, Rocket’s Welcome Home RateBreak program offers 2 percent off your mortgage rate in your first year and 1 percent off in your second year. This is referred to as a temporary buydown.
- Refinancing with Rocket Mortgage
- Rocket Mortgage offers both rate-and-term and cash-out refinancing options.
- How to apply for a mortgage with Rocket Mortgage
- You can apply for a mortgage with Rocket Mortgage online or by phone at 888-452-8179.

- How to compare mortgage lenders
- Your first step to finding the best mortgage lender is to comparison shop. Borrowers who do more upfront research tend to save more money than those who go with the first lender they find. It’s best to get quotes from three lenders, at minimum. Because rates fluctuate frequently, it’s also best to get these quotes on the same day.
- As you compare loan estimates, look at the APR (annual percentage rate) and interest rate quoted by each lender. Consider what’s important to you as far as experience, too. For some, how fast a lender can turn around a preapproval letter or close a loan is critical. If you have specific needs or financing preferences — for example, you want an FHA loan — you might want to focus on the top mortgage lenders who specialize in those loans.
- Once you determine what your needs and preferences are, get started by comparing mortgage rates.
- What are the different types of mortgages?
- There are several types of mortgage loans: conventional conforming loans; jumbo loans; FHA, VA and USDA loans; and fixed- and adjustable-rate mortgages. Conventional loans, offered by private financial institutions, are ideal for borrowers with strong credit scores. Jumbo loans are for higher-priced homes that exceed Federal Housing Finance Agency borrowing limits. FHA, VA and USDA loans are either government-guaranteed or government-insured and designed for borrowers with lower credit scores and low or no down payment, military members (VA loans) or those buying in a rural area (USDA loans). Fixed-rate mortgages have the same interest rate for the life of the loan, while the rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) can fluctuate.

- How do you get a mortgage?
- Before applying for a mortgage, it’s important to bolster your credit score and savings and have a clear understanding of how much you can afford and what type of loan would best fit your needs. In addition, gather documentation about your finances so you’re prepared to complete a mortgage application when the time comes. Once you’ve taken these initial steps, begin comparing mortgage lenders based on factors such as annual percentage rate (APR), fees and your overall experience. It’s best to get rate quotes from at least three different lenders. When you know which lender you want to work with, get preapproved so you can start house-hunting with financing in hand.

- The minimum down payment requirement varies based on loan type. If you qualify, you can obtain a 3 percent-down conventional loan, a 3.5 percent-down FHA loan or a no-down payment VA or USDA loan. If you want to avoid paying mortgage insurance, however, you’ll need to make a down payment of 20 percent.

- Every lender holds different regulations for loan amounts but if you have too little remaining or even too much, lenders may stray away. Typical minimums to refinance fall around $3,000 while maximums are usually under $50,000.

- Time remaining on loan
- Depending on where you stand in the lifetime of your loan, refinancing might not be possible. Most lenders expect you to be at least six months in and have at least six months remaining. On the other end, if you're far into the loan it might be better to just pay it off than apply for refinancing.

- Credit score
- The better your credit score is, the more competitive rates you will receive. So while perfect credit is not a requirement, anything that is below 600 likely won’t leave you with a better rate — and could even cost you more.

- The auto refinance process
- Apply
- Get a new loan
- The first step when refinancing your auto loan requires you to determine if the process is the right financial move. The main two scenarios that refinance might be a good idea are: if you can walk away with a better rate or if you are having trouble making payments.
- In order to decide if it is the right choice you must take the time to review your current loan. It’s best to use a calculator and compare potential savings against what you pay for your existing financing. Finally take stock of your credit score to ensure that you can ultimately walk away with an improved loan. Remember: If your score is at the same spot as when you signed — or worse, lower — refi might not benefit you.

- The refinance application process is likely going to be fairly similar to what you did when you applied for your initial loan. After shopping around at three or more lenders you can apply with the one that best fits your needs. Most lenders allow for an online application, but you will likely have a hard credit pull before acceptance — which can lower your score slightly.
- Pay close attention to the specific requirements that the lender carries when it comes to mileage, vehicle type, time you've had the loan and remaining loan balance. On top of this, it is a good idea to get your paperwork in order ahead of applying. This includes details about your vehicle — and information about your existing loan that you wouldn’t have needed for your first loan application.

- Either way, it is wise to confirm this process was done before halting payments on your old loan so you don't wind up with late fees or other charges.

- Auto refinance is the right choice if you can save money — specifically on incurred interest — or you need relief and can't get your loan modified. But as interest rates continue to rise due to high inflation, determining if it is right for you requires extra consideration.
- Reasons to consider refinancing your auto loan
- Your credit has improved Credit score serves as the primary goal post for the rates lenders will offer you. If your credit has improved since you initially signed off on your loan, it could be worth your while to refinance and receive more competitive rates.
- To lower your monthly paymentIf your current loan is straining your finances and you're at risk of missing a payment, refinancing may be a good option. Pay close attention to the amount you extend your loan term though, the longer it is the more interest you pay over the lifetime of the loan.
- Requirements to refinance an auto loan
- It is best to take advantage of an auto refinance calculator that will do the heavy lifting for you. Once you have a handle on how much you could potentially save you begin your refinance process.
- How to calculate auto refinance savings
- To determine potential savings from refinancing your auto loan you'll need to compare your current loan with the new one. This is not as simple as looking at the two monthly payment numbers, instead, you must factor in how total interest comes into play.

- Does refinance start your loan over?
- While yes, it does restart your loan, it is not a perfect fresh start. Ideally, your new terms will be more affordable thus making it easy to start fresh. Once your old loan is paid off, previous payments will not carry over.

- Do you need cash to refinance a car loan?
- While you can now take a deep breath with a new and improved loan in hand, there is still some important work to be done. These considerations will ensure you stay on top of your new loan.
- Finish up payments on your previous loan.
- Until you get the go ahead from your previous lender it is important to continue making payments on your loan. If an issue arises and you overpay, the lender can likely credit the amount back to you. Once you receive the new loan either you or your lender will handle the final loan payment. Check with your lender to avoid any additional charges.
- Start paying your new loan.
- Payment schedules vary by lender but generally, you will be expected to begin making payments 30 days after accepting the loan. It is wise to set up automatic payments if it is available to prevent any missed payments. Along with this, do not put off any payments in order to avoid any building interest. If you feel yourself heading into a precarious spot contact your lender and explain the situation before it gets too late.

URL: https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/what-is-home-equity-loan


Application Process:
- Home equity loans drawbacks include putting your home at risk of foreclosure and a lengthy application process.
- What is a home equity loan?
- A home equity loan is a type of second mortgage secured by the equity in your home. It offers a set amount at a fixed interest rate, so it’s best for borrowers who know exactly how much money they need. You’ll receive the funds in a lump sum, then make regular monthly repayments amortized over the term of the loan, typically as long as 30 years.
- Because your home is the collateral for the loan, the amount you’ll be able to borrow is related to its current market value. The interest rate you receive on a home equity loan (as with other loans) will vary depending on your lender, credit score, income and other factors.
- As of mid-February 2025, home equity loan rates for the benchmark $30,000 loan are averaging 8.40 percent, within a tight range of 8.04 to 9.24 percent.
- While today’s home equity loan rates are higher compared to their average of 6 percent in 2022, they’re still significantly lower than other forms of consumer debt. Credit card rates are lingering above the 20-percent mark, and personal loans can stretch into the 25–35 percent range for borrowers with less-than-perfect credit scores.
- While today’s home equity loan rates are higher compared to their average of 6 percent in 2022, they’re still significantly lower than other forms of consumer debt. Credit card rates are lingering above the 20-percent mark, and personal loans can stretch into the 25–35 percent range for borrowers with less-than-perfect credit scores.
- How does a home equity loan work?
- When you take out a home equity loan, the lender approves you for a loan amount based on the percentage of equity you have in your home (among other factors). You’ll receive the loan proceeds in a lump sum, then repay what you borrowed in fixed monthly installments that include principal and interest over a set period. Although terms vary, home equity loans can be repaid over a period as long as 30 years.
- Since the loan is secured by your home, the property could be foreclosed upon if you can’t repay what you borrowed: The lender has a right to seize it to recoup its money. If that happens, it can cause serious damage to your credit score, making it harder for you to qualify for future loans.
- Home equity loans in 2025
- That means many homeowners are sitting on a huge pile of equity they can leverage to access cash, including through a home equity loan. In the third quarter of 2024, according to CoreLogic, the average mortgage-holding homeowner gained about $5,700 in equity year-over-year, making their ownership stake worth around $312,000. Around $203,000 of that is tappable (that is, able to be withdrawn while leaving 20 percent of the equity stake intact).
- Adding to the temptation to tap: Home equity loan rates — along with those of HELOCs, their line-of-credit cousins — have been on the decline, reflecting the Federal Reserve’s reduction of its benchmark interest rate last autumn. Assuming the Fed continues to cut, Bankrate’s 2025  forecast calls for home equity rates to drop to 7.90 percent, a level not seen since early 2023.
- Originations of home equity loans rose 8 percent in Q3 2024, according to TransUnion’s latest Mortgage Credit Industry Insights Report. Their popularity outstripped HELOCs and cash-out refinances, the other two home equity financing methods.
- Home equity loan requirements
- Lenders have different requirements for home equity loans, but generally, the standards include:
- Credit score: Mid-600s or higher
- Employment and income: At least two years of employment history and pay stubs from the past 30 days
- Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio: No more than 43 percent
- Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio: No more than 80 percent
- If you fall short in any of these areas, your chances of approval decrease significantly. And times are getting tougher for borrowing in general. Nearly half (48 percent) of Americans who applied for a loan or financial product between December 2023 and December 2024 were turned down, including the 4 percent who were home equity loans and HELOCs applicants, according to Bankrate’s latest Credit Denials Survey.
- Ways to get the best home equity loan rates
- Here are some practical ways to boost your chances of getting approved for a home equity loan:
- Home equity borrowers need better-than-average credit. You can improve your score by reducing your debt, paying bills on time, and fixing errors on your credit report.
- “Equity-rich” borrowers, who own more than 50 percent of their homes outright, make the strongest candidates. Increase your home equity stake by making extra mortgage payments and investing in renovations that enhance your home’s value. The more equity you have, the lower the lender’s risk.
- Minimal debt will also improve your chances. Lower your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) by paying down your outstanding balances: Try not to use more than about one-third of your available credit on any card. A lower DTI shows lenders you have a good balance between income and outlay, and that you can handle an additional monthly obligation.
- Compare home equity loan terms and rates with at least three banks, credit unions, or online lenders. Each lender has different criteria, so it’s best to shop around. Don’t be afraid to ask for a better deal. The worst they can say is no.
- What should you use a home equity loan for?
- You can use the funds from a home equity loan for any purpose. Some of the best reasons to use one include:
- Upgrading your home: Whether you’re looking to remodel your kitchen, add an in-law suite or install solar shingles on your roof, a home equity loan can be a smart way to pay for the enhancements. You’ll be improving your home, which means you get to enjoy living there more; and when you’re ready to sell, the upgrade can potentially make it more attractive (and more valuable) to buyers. Plus, you can qualify for some tax benefits — a deduction on the interest — when you use a loan to invest in the property in this way.
- Consolidating high-interest debt: If you’ve been struggling to pay off debts with high costs like credit cards, a home equity loan can make a big difference in the amount of interest you’re paying. However, if you’re considering this route, there are two important caveats. First, you need to have a real commitment to not build those credit card balances up again. Second, the amount of debt needs to be fairly significant. Credit card balance transfers can be a better option if you’re aiming to pay off less than $10,000.
- Covering large medical bills: Health care can be incredibly expensive, and medical problems often arise unexpectedly. If you or a family member needs a procedure, treatment or long-term care that isn’t fully covered by insurance, a home equity loan could be a good way to handle these healthcare costs.
- When you should avoid getting a home equity loan
- If you’re thinking about using a home equity loan and any of these describe you, think again:
- Paying for college: You may find lenders who advocate paying college tuition via home equity, but this is a risky move. There is no guarantee that your child is going to graduate, but there is certainly a guarantee that you need to have a home. Look at taking out federal student loans in your child’s name instead: Their interest rates are lower, and they come with benefits like income-based repayment options.
- Paying for a relatively small project: If you only need a small amount of cash – think less than $10,000 – you may be better off looking for other options such as a credit card with a long, zero-percent APR period or simply using savings, even if that means delaying the project for a time.
- How much can I borrow with a home equity loan?
- To figure out how much you might be able to borrow with a home equity loan, you first need to understand how much home equity you actually have. Your equity is the essentially difference between how much your home is worth and how much you owe on your first mortgage. For example, if your home’s current fair market value is $500,000 and you owe $250,000, you have a 50 percent equity stake.
- Most lenders will let you borrow up to 80 percent of your equity stake (some let you go as high as 85 or even 90 percent). However, there’s another factor to consider: How much all your loans amount to or your combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV). Most home equity loan lenders will cap your total amount of home-secured debt – including your first mortgage – at 80 percent of the home’s market value. So, in that case, you would likely be able to borrow up to $150,000, taking your total mortgage debt to $400,000 (80 percent of $500,000). Bankrate’s home equity calculator can help you estimate your exact borrowing power.
- Home equity loan pros and cons
- Pros of home equity loans
- Attractive interest rates: Home equity lenders typically charge lower interest rates compared to the rates on personal loans and credit cards. This is because home equity loans are a type of secured debt, meaning they’re backed by some sort of collateral (in this case, your house) — which makes them less risky for the lender, compared to unsecured debt, which isn’t backed by anything.
- Fixed monthly payments: Home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed interest rate and a fixed monthly payment. This might make it easier for you to budget for and pay each month. This also eliminates the possibility of getting hit with a higher payment with a variable-rate product, like a credit card or home equity line of credit (HELOC).
- Tax advantages: You could be eligible for a tax deduction of the loan interest if you use the loan proceeds to substantially improve or repair the home. Check with an accountant or tax professional to learn more about this deduction and to determine if it’s available to you.
- Cons of home equity loans
- Home on the line: Your home is the collateral for a home equity loan, so if you can’t repay it, your lender could foreclose.
- No flexibility: If you’re not sure how much money you need to borrow (you’re planning a big remodeling project, say), a home equity loan might not be the best choice. Because home equity loans only offer a fixed lump sum, you run the risk of borrowing too little. On the flip side, you might borrow too much, which you’ll still need to repay with interest (though you might be able to settle the debt early, if that’s the case).
- Lengthy, costly application: Applying for a home equity loan is akin to applying for a mortgage; though somewhat simpler, it often means lots of paperwork, a long process and closing costs.
- Home equity loan alternatives
- A home equity loan isn’t your only option for borrowing against your ownership stake. Some alternatives include:
- Home equity line of credit (HELOC): A HELOC – short for home equity line of credit – is also secured by the equity in your home and has similar requirements, but it operates a bit differently. With a HELOC, you can borrow money on an as-needed basis, up to a set limit, typically over a 10-year draw period. During that time, you’ll just have to make interest-only payments on what you borrow. This means that your payments may be smaller than a home equity loan, which includes both interest and principal. When the draw period on the HELOC ends, you’ll repay what you borrowed and any interest, usually over a repayment term of up to 20 years. Unlike home equity loans, HELOCs have variable interest rates, which means your monthly payments can change.
- Shared equity agreements: Investment companies like Unlock and Hometap offer shared equity agreements, which let homeowners access cash now in exchange for a portion of the home’s value in the future. These arrangements vary, but they all have one upside: You don’t have to make monthly payments, because the money is technically not a loan, but an investment — funds in exchange for a share in your home. However, they all have the same downside: You’re going to make a big payment eventually, and it will likely wind up coming out of the proceeds when you sell the home.
- Cash-out refinance: Another option to convert a portion of your home equity into ready money is through a cash-out refi. Unlike a home equity loan, a cash-out refi replaces your current mortgage with a new one for a higher amount, with you taking the difference between the outstanding balance and the new balance in cash. You’ll need to think carefully about a cash-out refi based on the rate attached to your current mortgage. If you managed to lock in a super-low rate during the pandemic, a cash-out refinance is almost certain to lock you into a significantly higher rate.
- Personal loans: Personal loans can be a cost-effective route if your credit score is in 760-and-above territory. These are unsecured loans – meaning you won’t have to put your house on the line. However, borrowing limits tend to be lower, and the repayment period will be shorter than most home equity loans’.
- Home equity loans FAQ
- Does taking out a home equity loan hurt your credit?
- Taking on any form of debt, including a home equity loan, has an impact on your credit score. After you close on a home equity loan, your score might decrease temporarily. Over time, as you continue to make timely payments on the loan, you might see your score recover and even improve, as well.

- How long do you have to repay a home equity loan?
- It varies by lender, but most home equity loans come with repayment periods between five and 30 years. A longer loan term means you’ll get more affordable monthly payments. That said, you’ll also pay far more in interest. If you can afford the higher monthly payments, selecting a shorter term maximizes overall cost. The ideal is to find a compromise between the two: the maximum manageable payments and the shortest loan term.

- Are there fees associated with home equity loans?
- Fees for home equity loans vary by lender, which makes it very important to compare offers. Some home equity lenders require you to pay an origination fee and other closing costs, typically between 2 percent and 5 percent of the loan balance. You might also pay a home appraisal fee. Once the loan proceeds are disbursed to you, late fees could apply if you remit payment after the monthly due date or grace period (if applicable).

- How hard is it to get a home equity loan?
- Qualifying for a home equity loan is typically a bit harder than getting a primary mortgage. For one, you’ll generally need a credit score in the mid-600s to get a home equity loan, while some mortgages — including FHA loans — only require a score in the 500s. But on top of that, most lenders will require you to have at least 20 percent equity in your property before taking out a home equity loan.

Eligibility Criteria:
- Good credit can help you make the most of your everyday purchases because you’ll have plenty of credit card options to pick from. “When you apply for a credit card, the issuing lender reviews your credit report and score to determine your eligibility and whether you qualify for a particular card,” says Rod Griffin, senior director of consumer education and advocacy at Experian. “The better your credit score, the more credit card options you could have.”
- But good credit isn’t just about having more options — it’s about having options with some of the best benefits. Here are some of the perks that come with good credit:
- Earn rewards: The right rewards or cash back card can help you pocket more money when redeeming your hard-earned rewards. The better your credit is, the more likely you are to qualify for cards that earn more rewards in more categories. The right card can help you earn significant rewards from your everyday spending.
- Maximize travel value: Many cards with boosted rates for travel offer solid value that can help you shoulder the burden of travel expenses. Look for cards with flexible travel redemption options or additional travel expense credits to add value.
- Access food and grocery perks: If food costs take up a large chunk of your budget, credit cards for good credit have some of the best rewards rates for these purchases. Many credit cards for good credit offer boosted rewards in several key spending categories, so choose one that best fits your culinary needs.
- “To make it work for you, you should use your credit card to pay routine expenses and bills and pay the card off every month,” says Griffin, highlighting the importance of routine spending and payment consistency. “Payment history is the biggest factor that affects your credit score and paying your credit card on time and in full every month will help you build a steady and strong credit history.”
- How to get good credit
- You can reach a good credit score by keeping low credit utilization, having a mix of credit and installment loans, using credit cards responsibly and having an established credit history.
- The amount of time it takes to get a good credit score depends on factors like your credit habits, the consistency of those habits and any past financial mishaps. The better you are at paying on time and not borrowing more than you can pay will impact how quickly your credit score goes up.
- Even though the Fed has cut interest rates, credit card APR’s are still high. With the current average credit card APR at more than 20 percent, keeping your balances low and maintaining good credit habits is more important than ever.
- What people say about having good credit
- Everyone’s experience with credit and money differs, but some experiences resonate with most people. As most people who’ve moved from a fair to a good credit score can tell you, one of the main benefits of having a good credit score is qualifying for better loan terms and better credit cards. With good credit, you can feel confident in your approval odds for far more lending products than you would with fair or bad credit.
- If you’ve ever been in a position where you were unsure about card or loan approval, then you’re familiar with the stress and anxiety that it provokes. Online communities, like r/CRedit*, are a venue for users to discuss their experiences with credit cards, credit scores and other financial products. In one thread in this subreddit users share their experience with having credit scores over 700, which would be considered “good credit.”
- I have a 780 [credit score] and am in the market to buy a car. The difference between last time and this time is night and day. Last time, I had poor credit and I was stressing about getting any loan and I very much needed a new car as what I had was unreliable.
- This time I’m not stressed about it at all and I just know I won’t have any problems getting the loan when the car comes in. It’s honestly kind of wild how much stress disappears with higher credit scores for big purchases.
- This comment shows how things can turn around when you achieve good credit or better. It also highlights the stigma associated with poor credit and the embarrassment of not getting approved for loans. Although no one should feel shame for their financial situation, it can be as distressing as it is inconvenient.
- What Bankrate experts say about good credit
- A good credit score is worth being proud of because it shows you’ve worked hard to pay your bills on time, avoid maxing out your cards and otherwise use credit responsibly — but the work doesn’t end here. Even Bankrate experts make patience a priority when it comes to maintaining a good credit score. According to Courtney Mihocik, senior editor at Bankrate, patience has been a contributing factor on her credit journey.
- One thing that really helped me on my journey toward good credit was patience. Not only did I have to be patient while working towards good credit, but now that I have good credit, I remain patient between applying for the cards I want. I try to limit my new card applications to one per year to maintain the average age of my accounts. I also wait between card applications to make sure I really want and will use a new credit card. Otherwise, it can take up meaningless space in my wallet and on my reports.

Financial Tips:
- Tips for choosing the best credit card for good credit
- Choosing a credit card for good credit will depend on many factors, including your financial needs.
- “You should be aiming to use a credit card that has a low interest rate, though this will be less important if you plan on paying your balance in full every month, and low-to-no fees,” notes Griffin.
- If you plan to pay in full every month, your interest rate won’t be much of a factor. Paying in full not only helps you reduce debt and interest payments, but it gives you the flexibility to explore the other benefits of good credit. “You may opt for a cash back credit card or one that gives you miles or travel points,” says Griffin. “Always remember that credit is a financial tool. When used well, it should give you financial advantages.”
- Here are some general tips to keep top of mind when choosing your new credit card for good credit:
- Focus on features: If you want a rewards card, decide if you want to earn cash back, points or miles. If you want to save money on interest from a balance you transfer, you might consider a low-interest or balance transfer card. Choose a credit card that fits your needs and don’t settle for one with flashy features if you can’t take advantage of them.
- Research each card’s benefits: Top perks include bonuses, perks and intro APR offers. Use these as you build toward an excellent score so you can qualify for cards with better perks.
- Assess rates, fees and your budget: Plenty of credit cards with no annual fee are available for people who don’t need all the bells and whistles that premium cards offer. Other typical rates and fees to watch out for include the annual percentage rate (APR), foreign transaction fee, late payment fee and balance transfer fee.
- Getting approved for a card for good credit
- Keep your expectations realistic and within the realm of your financial situation. Just because you have good credit doesn’t mean a card that requires good credit is a good fit for you. Issuers consider your income, expenses and revolving debt when evaluating your application, and they might determine that — despite your good credit score — you’re a risky borrower.
- To help your approval odds, keep your current card balances as low as possible, pay off installment loans if possible and make sure there are no inconsistencies on your credit report. Correcting mistakes, like updating your income and personal information or disputing errors on your credit report, could be just the boost you need to have a better shot at card approval.

- Our data: Good credit won’t guarantee approval
- Good credit only improves the likelihood of being approved for a new card, it doesn’t guarantee it. While issuers may use your credit score to assess the risk of lending you money, it may not tell the whole story.
- We looked at the approval rates of card applications on our site in 2024. Based on our data on credit card approvals, several cards actually have low approval rates for applicants with good credit. On average across all of the cards analyzed, good credit users were approved roughly 33 percent of the time for a card they applied for, while excellent credit users were approved about 64 percent of the time for cards they applied for. This suggests that excellent credit users are more likely than good credit users to get approved for cards that require good credit, but that nothing is certain in even the best scoring bracket.
- These approvals are also a pretty dramatic change from the data for 2023, where good credit users were approved about 44 percent of the time and excellent credit users were approved almost 75 percent of the time. While this reflects that fewer good and excellent credit users are receiving approvals for cards they apply for, fair credit users have seen more approvals on average in 2024 than they did in 2023: about 35 percent compared to about 20 percent, respectively.
- Although our data clearly indicates that approval rates are higher overall for applicants with good credit than those with fair or bad credit, a good credit score is still no guarantee of approval. Applicants with both good and excellent credit showed a wide range of approval rates based on the cards applied for.
- Overall, our data showed a wide range of approval rates for applicants with good credit — from around 40 percent on some cards to over 95 percent on others.

- Frequently asked questions about credit cards for good credit scores
- How do you go from good to excellent credit?
- There’s no quick fix for improving your credit score. Taking consistent action over time, even a relatively short period of time, is the key to boosting your credit score. If you have credit card debt, have a plan to pay it all off. Make sure your payments are always on time. If you have a close friend or family member who has good credit, ask if they’ll add you as an authorized user to their existing credit account, which will improve your score when the card shows up on your credit report.

- The basic difference between the two is the FICO score range. A fair credit score is between 580 and 669 while a good credit score ranges between 670 and 739.
- Being one level below good credit can make a huge difference when you apply for credit, as you could miss out on access to great offers and end up paying higher interest when you borrow money.

- How we assess the best cards for good credit
- When evaluating the best credit cards for good credit, we take into account several factors, including how cards score in our proprietary card rating system and whether they offer features that fit the priorities of a diverse group of cardholders, from earning rewards to scoring a large sign-up bonus to saving on interest.
- We analyzed over 250 of the most popular credit cards and selected standouts that are available with good credit. We scored each card based on the factors most relevant to its primary category, including its rewards rate, estimated annual earnings, intro APR period, ongoing APR, perks and more to determine whether it belonged in this month’s roundup.
- Since many cardholders with good credit are eager to earn rewards, a key criteria for a card’s inclusion in our list is whether it offers impressive rewards value. This includes a card’s average rewards rate, estimated annual rewards earnings, sign-up bonus value and reward redemption value.
- We use consumer spending data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to get a reliable third-party measure of people’s spending habits. The most recent BLS data estimates average total spending in 2023 was $77,280 per consumer. We then narrow our focus to which purchases are likely to be put on a credit card and earn rewards, subtracting expenditures like housing, vehicle purchases and education. This gives us a total “chargeable” annual spend of around $22,500.
- With these calculations complete, we assign each card a score based on how its average rewards earnings, sign-up bonus value, rewards rate and redemption value stack up against other cards in its primary category.
- The better these values, the the higher its score will be, making it more worthy of inclusion in our list and increasing its potential ranking.

- We also rate all cards based on how their ongoing average APR compares to the average APR you’ll find other cards in their primary category. However, the impact of an especially high or low APR on a card’s overall score depends on its primary category.
- For rewards-earning cards, this factor has only a minor influence on the card’s score and whether the card is included in our list, since rewards card users generally try to avoid carrying a balance. That said, rewards-earning cards may get a solid boost in score and be more worthy of inclusion in our list if they also offer an intro APR on balance transfers or new purchases, since such offers aren’t always present on these cards.
- More important to these cards’ scores and their inclusion in our list is how their annual fees influence their overall value. We consider a card’s annual fee in two ways — how it ranks relative to the fees you’ll find on other cards in the category and how it impacts a card’s overall rewards value.
- Cards with an annual fee will always be at a slight disadvantage in our scoring system since annual fees inherently cut into your rewards value. However, if a card offers terrific value via its ongoing rewards and perks, it can earn a high score and a spot in our list even if it carries a high annual fee. After all, the highest rewards rates and most valuable perks are often found on cards with annual fees.
- Interest rates and intro APR offers play a much larger role in a card’s score and whether it’s included in our list when the card is designed specifically for users looking to save on interest charges, such as dedicated balance transfer or low-interest cards.

Application Process:
- Citizens Property Insurance Corporation of Florida is a nonprofit insurer operating in the state of Florida only. It was established in 2002 to provide a last-resort option for homeowners in Florida's troubled insurance market who were not able to find coverage elsewhere. The increase in violent and unpredictable weather patterns in the state has spurred some insurers to stop underwriting policies here, and the average cost of homeowners coverage in Florida is considerably higher than the national average.

Financial Tips:
- Commercial properties: Citizens can offer multiperil and wind-only policies to qualifying commercial properties that are used for residential purposes such as apartment buildings and retirement community buildings. These policies exclude personal liability coverage. Non-residential commercial properties may qualify for wind-only policies.
- To file a claim with Citizens, you can call 1-866-411-2742 or file the report online with Citizens myPolicy. When filing a claim, you may be asked for information like your policy number, your contact information, a description of the damage (including the date that it happened) and information about your mortgage company (if you have one). Once your claim has been filed, a Citizens adjuster will review your policy and the details of your loss to determine if you have coverage for the damage.

- Bankrate Scores
- Our 2025 Bankrate Score considers variables our insurance editorial team determined impact policyholders’ experiences with an insurance company. These rating factors include a robust assessment of each company’s cost of coverage, product availability, financial strength ratings, online capabilities and customer and claims support accessibility. We grouped these factors into three essential categories — cost and ratings, coverage and savings, and support — which we then weighted in a tiered approach.
- Each category was assigned a metric to determine performance, and the weighted sum adds up to a company’s total Bankrate Score — out of 5 points. Our scoring model provides a comprehensive view, indicating when companies excel across several key areas and highlighting where they fall short.
- Tier scores are unweighted to show the company's true score in each category out of a possible five points.
- In May 2024, Bankrate collaborated with market research firm SliceMR to survey over 1,500 insurance customers nationwide, asking policyholders to rate their insurer’s cost, coverage, customer support and overall experience on a five-point scale. Bankrate and SliceMR collected and analyzed these customer ratings, along with website analytics and responses to three open-ended questions regarding customer experience. Responses are based on individual policyholders’ policy details and personal experience, and therefore cannot be verified for accuracy. Users received an incentive for their feedback. All ratings are unedited and have not been reviewed or approved by insurance carriers. User-generated ratings are separate from carrier Bankrate Scores — which are calculated based on our proprietary methodology — and may not match.

APRs for variable-rate loans may increase after origination if the SOFR index increases.

- ELFI: Best for large loan amounts
- Bankrate Score = 4.4/5Bankrate scores are objectively determined by our editorial team. Our scoring formula weighs several factors consumers should consider when choosing financial products and services.
- The range of loan amounts that a lender will service. The maximum value is the largest amount a lender will give although this amount may not be available to borrowers who don’t have good or excellent credit. Amount ranges may vary for non-loan products. Term refers to the amount of time you have to repay the loan.

- Be the age of majority at the time of application
- Earned a bachelor’s degree or higher from a Title IV, U.S. domiciled nonprofit postsecondary institution at the time of application

- Your Starting Interest Rate (upon approval)
- The interest rate you pay will be determined after you apply. It will be based upon your credit history, the loan term you select, and other factors. If approved, we will notify you of the rate you qualify for.
- Your Interest Rate during the life of a loan: Fixed-Rate Loans
- Your rate is fixed and will depend on the loan term that you select. This means that your interest rate will never change during the life of your loan.
- Your Interest Rate during the life of the loan: Variable-Rate Loans*
- Your rate is variable. This means that your rate could move lower or higher than the rates on your disclosure. Although the interest rate will vary after you are approved, the interest rate will never exceed 18% for the 5-year, 7-year, 10-year, or 15-year term. Your loan amount will not exceed the cost of attendance less financial aid as certified by your school. For variable rate loans applied for after 7:00 PM EST on January 7, 2022, the variable interest rate will be based on a publicly available index, the Prime Rate of Interest as published in the Money Market Section of the Wall Street Journal. These variable rates will be calculated and set each month by adding a margin between -2.50% to 5.72% to the Prime Rate. If you have an existing variable rate loan that uses the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as the benchmark rate index, your loan will continue to use the LIBOR as the benchmark rate index. These rates will be calculated by adding a margin between 1.05% to 11.39% to the 3-month LIBOR. Your rate will not increase more than once quarterly. ELFI will notify borrowers with existing variable rate loans originated prior to 7:00 PM EST on January 7, 2022, of the expected change from LIBOR to the Prime Rate in the future.

- Once you find a lender that best suits your financial situation, check its specific eligibility requirements. Though exact ones may vary, there are a few common requirements for refinancing student loans to be aware of.
- Debt-to-income ratio: Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is a measurement of how much debt you've accumulated compared to your monthly earnings. You have a better chance of getting approved if your debt-to-income ratio is below 50 percent.
- Credit score: When you apply for any loan, your credit score matters. Check your lender's credit score requirements before applying. If your credit score is in the mid-600s or lower, you may need to add a cosigner to your loan to qualify.
- Income: Lenders may impose a minimum income threshold, and they will likely want to see proof of employment — this tells them that you have the cash to make your monthly payments. Come prepared with recent paystubs, W2 forms or recent bank statements, as most lenders require documentation.
- Refinancing amount: You will likely need to owe a minimum of $5,000 in student loans if you'd like to refinance. If you have less than that, most lenders won't work with you.
- Degree: You'll typically need a completed college degree to be eligible for student loan refinancing, though some lenders accept borrowers regardless of degree status.
- If the lender you're considering offers a prequalification tool, you can see your estimated rate based on your general financial history with a soft credit inquiry, which won't hurt your credit score.
- Should I refinance my student loans?
- Refinancing your student loans makes financial sense only if the loan you apply for has a lower interest rate than the current interest rate of your student loans. You can use a loan calculator to determine your current monthly payment versus that of the loan you're considering.
- If you decide to refinance to a longer term to lower your monthly payments, keep in mind that you'll likely increase the overall cost of your loan through interest accrual.
- Whether you should refinance also depends on what type of loans you have. Refinancing could be smart if you have private loans, but you'll lose benefits if you refinance federal loans. These benefits include:
- Income-driven repayment plans (IDRs): An IDR can create lower monthly payments based on your income and family size and any remaining balance after your repayment term ends could be forgiven.
- Loan forgiveness programs: These programs forgive loan balances for those in qualifying careers, like public service, those with permanent disabilities and those whose schools engaged in misconduct or fraud.
- Deferment and forbearance options: Borrowers in a temporary financial bind may be able to suspend their payments until they get their footing. However, interest will continue to accrue, and they won't be able to make progress toward forgiveness during this time.
- Pros and cons of refinancing student loans
- Before choosing a lender, consider whether refinancing your student loans is the best move for your current situation.
- Consolidate several student loans into one loan with one payment each month.
- Private lenders usually require good or excellent credit (or a co-signer) to qualify.
- You lose opportunities for deferment, forbearance and income-driven repayment plans if you refinance federal loans.
- Ask the experts: When should you refinance a student loan?

- "There are two ways of refinancing a student loan.

Application Process:
- 1. Find out about other options. The Federal Direct Consolidation Loan may have student loan benefits and terms not detailed on this form. Visit the Department of Education’s website at www.StudentLoans.gov for more information about other consolidation loans. 2. To apply for this loan, complete the application. If you are approved for this loan, the loan terms will be available for 30 days (terms will not change during this period, except as permitted by law).
- Interest Rate: Your interest rate will depend on the loan term that you select. Interest rates are valid within the preceding 30 days.
- Immediate: The borrower starts repaying the loan while still in school. The monthly payment will cover the monthly interest and some of the principal borrowed. This option will have the highest monthly payments while in school, but will save the borrower the most money throughout the life of the loan.
- Fixed: The borrower pays a fixed monthly payment of $25.00 while in school and grace period. This amount will first be applied to interest, and any leftover will be applied to the principal. Any unpaid interest will be added to the principal balance of the loan upon the end of the borrowers grace period.
- Interest Only: The borrower makes monthly payments to cover the monthly interest while the borrower is in school and grace period. These payments will not include any payment toward the principal of the loan. The principal balance will remain unchanged unless the borrower pays extra.
- Deferred: The borrower makes no monthly payments while in school and grace period. The loan will accrue interest while the borrower is in school and grace period. Upon the end of the grace period, the accrued interest will be added to the principal amount of the loan. Depending on the repayment option you select, your loan may defer payment of principal and/or interest while you are enrolled at least half-time at a post-secondary educational institution. If your loan includes a deferment period, interest will accrue from the disbursement of the loan through the end of the deferment period. Any accrued but unpaid interest during that time will be added to the loan’s principal balance. The lender does not offer payment deferral options once your full payments of principal and interest begin. The lender may in its sole discretion agree to modify the loan or extend other repayment assistance to you on request.

- What is student loan refinancing?
- Student loan refinancing is the process of taking out a new loan to pay off your existing student loans. When you refinance your student loans, you may qualify for a lower interest rate and a different repayment timeline. The best time to refinance your student loans is when it saves you money on interest or lowers your monthly payments.
- Borrowers with good credit, in particular, will qualify for the best student loan rates. You can refinance both federal and private student loans, though it's usually best to avoid refinancing federal loans since they come with a number of perks that aren't available through private lenders.
- Student loan refinancing requirements
- Just as you did when initially borrowing for your education, the student loan refinancing process requires you to apply for a new loan. This loan will pay off your remaining student loan balance and have new terms and rates. Borrowers often choose to refinance to lower their rate or extend their term. However, while a longer term may lower your monthly payment, it can cause you to pay more in total interest.
- The process to refinance your student loan requires the following 5 steps:
- Research lenders: There are many options available when it comes to refinancing your loan. Compile a list of potential lenders so you can compare features and rates.
- Shop for the best loan options: Every lender has its own acceptance criteria based on your credit score and loan. Shop around with many lenders to ensure you are getting the best new loan for your needs.
- Submit a loan application: To apply for a loan you will likely need to share information on your current student loan, personal contact information and any cosigner documents.
- Transfer payments to your new lender: Make sure that your old loan closes so you can begin making payments on your new loan. Be on the lookout for a payoff letter from your old lender to confirm the process has been completed.

- Credit score requirements vary from lender to lender, but you'll likely need a credit score in the mid to high 600s to refinance your student loans.

- Will refinancing affect my credit score?
- When you apply for refinancing, your credit score may drop a few points, since the lender will perform a hard inquiry on your credit report. You may also lose a few points if refinancing causes the average age of your accounts to drop. However, in the long run, refinancing may actually be beneficial for your credit score if it helps you make payments on time and pay off your debt more quickly.

- How do I choose between a fixed-rate and a variable-rate loan?
- Most private lenders will let you refinance with either a fixed or a variable interest rate. With a fixed rate, your interest rate will never change, meaning your monthly payment will remain consistent. With a variable interest rate, your interest rate fluctuates based on market conditions.
- The choice between a fixed or variable rate depends on your risk tolerance. If you value predictability in your finances, a fixed rate is a better choice — particularly if rates are low. You have the chance to save more money with a variable interest rate if interest rates fall, but the inverse is true as well. Interest rates could rise during your repayment term, costing you more money overall unless you can pay off your loan early.

- Overview: RISLA allows current students the option of refinancing their student loans while still enrolled through a unique benefit — its 'pay-later' loan. Although repayment will begin a short six months after graduating, the lender will defer your payments while still in school, which can help you save on interest accrual.
- For federal loans, you can obtain a Federal Direct Consolidation Loan. This combines multiple federal education loans into a single loan, making it easier to repay. You may be able to qualify for alternate repayment plans by consolidating. Consolidation doesn't really change the cost of the loan, since the interest rate on a consolidation loan is the weighted average of the interest rates on the loans included in the consolidation loan, rounded up to the nearest 1/8th of a percentage point. If you choose a longer repayment term, the monthly payment may decrease, but you will be in debt for longer and pay more interest over the life of the loan.
- For federal and private student loans, you can obtain a private refi, which pays off the old loans with a new private student loan. The interest rate on the private refi is based on your credit score, and the credit score of your cosigner if any. If your credit scores have improved a lot, you may be able to qualify for a lower interest rate. A private refi can also change the repayment term, which can affect the size of the monthly student loan payment.
- Thus, there are several possible reasons to refinance a student loan, such as changing the loan servicer, changing the repayment plan or repayment term, changing the monthly payment, and obtaining a different interest rate."
- Writer, Personal Loans and Debt Relief
- "Refinancing is only a good idea if you fit within the two categories: you have a hard time organizing your student loan payments and you'd qualify for a lower interest rate with a new loan. Most lenders offer a prequalification tool that allows you to see what your predicted rates would be if you were to qualify. If you have fairly high rates on your existing loans, it may be a good option to refinance. However, be certain you’re scoring a lower rate with a refinance loan. Due to the current high-rate environment, unless you have sky-high rates and a stellar credit score, it may not make sense to refinance until rates cool off."

Eligibility Criteria:
- The most common solution when grants and scholarships fall short of paying for college is to take out a federal or private student loan. It’s generally a good idea to max out your federal student loan eligibility before considering applying for a private loan.
- Check your eligibility. Before applying, determine whether your credit history and income meet the lender’s qualifications. You can check your credit reports for free weekly at AnnnualCreditReport.com. To qualify for a private student loan on your own, you generally need to have good credit, which is generally a FICO score 670 or above. If you don’t meet the requirements, you’ll need a cosigner who can.
- Prequalify with multiple lenders. Different lenders have different eligibility criteria. By prequalifying with multiple lenders, you increase your chances of getting the best deal.
- What to consider before you get a student loan
- You will typically pay back your student loans over the course of many years, so it can be helpful to consider the following before applying.
- Student loans, whether federal or private, have to be repaid at some point, and all loans come with an additional charge in the form of interest. Grants and scholarships, however, don’t have to be repaid as long as you meet the requirements.
- Some colleges, universities and career schools offer institutional grants, so ask the financial aid office about your options. You can also apply for scholarships and grants offered by private organizations — scholarship search engines maintain databases that list millions of aid opportunities.
- Private vs. federal student loans
- Federal loans are the preferred student loan options because, unlike private ones, they come with access to loan forgiveness and income-driven repayment plans. They’re also the best choice if you’re looking to qualify for a student loan with poor credit — most federal loans don’t require a credit check.
- That said, private student loans can be a great option when you don’t qualify for enough federal aid. Many lenders allow you to borrow up to your school’s cost of attendance, and this may come in handy if you’ve maxed out your federal loan limit. Options for deferment and forbearance also vary by lender. And if the loan comes with a variable interest rate, it can increase anytime during repayment.
- You can use your school’s COA to create a budget to determine how much money you’ll need per academic year. Then subtract any funds you expect to get from scholarships, grants and a part-time job, if applicable. Private student loans can then finance the remaining costs.
- Before applying for loans, crunch the numbers to understand the long-term impact of loans on your financial health. Use a student loan calculator to figure out what your monthly payments will be after graduation and whether you’re comfortable with the amount. Also, check how long it will take to pay off the debt and how much interest you’ll pay over the life of the loan.
- Knowing how to get a student loan is a crucial part of planning for college, especially if you’ve exhausted your scholarship and grant options. Start by filling out the FAFSA to see how much federal aid you can qualify for. Then, assess your aid package, including federal student loans, before determining how much of a gap there may be to cover your total bill.
- To qualify for a student loan, complete the FAFSA to check for federal loan eligibility. Federal loans require U.S. citizenship or eligible noncitizen status, a valid Social Security number, enrollment in an eligible program, satisfactory academic progress and, for men ages 18-25, Selective Service registration.
- Direct Subsidized Loans are need-based, while Unsubsidized and PLUS Loans are not. Private loans require a credit check and may need a cosigner, with specific lender criteria for eligibility.

- Is it hard to get approved for student loans?
- Approval for student loans depends on the loan type and your financial situation. Federal student loans usually don’t require a credit check, making them easier to get for most students.
- However, private loans often require a good credit score, a minimum income and at least half-time enrollment in an eligible institution. If you don’t meet these criteria, a cosigner may be necessary. Always check the eligibility requirements and consider federal loans first for their favorable terms.

- Can I get my own student loan?
- Independent students can apply for federal student loans without needing their parents’ income information by completing the FAFSA. Factors like age, marital status and military service can qualify you for independent status.
- If you’re a dependent student unable to provide parent info, consider a dependency override or unsubsidized federal loans. Private student loans are also an option, potentially requiring a cosigner or proof of creditworthiness or academic merit.

Application Process:
- The application process for federal student loans is separate from the private student loans application process, and the lending terms tend to differ between the two.
- You’ll need to fill out the FAFSA form, which is free and opens in October each year, in order to unlock federal student loans and federal student aid.
- Private student loans come from banks, credit unions and online lenders, and each lender typically has a different process for applying and different requirements for approval.
- However, it is wise to evaluate each option’s pros and cons before submitting an application. Understanding how the loan application process works for different types of student loans — federal and private — can prepare you to take out one.
- How to get a federal student loan
- To unlock federal student loans and federal student aid, you’ll need to fill out the FAFSA form. It’s free and opens in October each year. Fill it out the year before you plan to attend school and reapply with a new FAFSA form each school year.
- Because federal student loans come with generous borrower protections and no credit check, it’s best to apply for these before seeking private loans, especially if you’re an undergraduate student.
- Set up an account. Before you apply for a federal student loan, you have to create a Federal Student Aid (FSA) account to complete the FAFSA online.
- Gather your documents. You can get a sneak peek of the FAFSA on the worksheet provided by the FSA. Compile a list of schools that should receive your FAFSA form and gather your proof of identification and finances. You’ll also have to collect these materials from your parents if you’re listed as a dependent.
- Receive your financial aid offers. The colleges you listed on the FAFSA will calculate your financial aid and send you a financial aid letter, which may include a mix of loans, grants and work-study options.
- Complete loan counseling. Before you receive a loan, you’re required to complete loan entrance counseling to learn how your loan works, including repayment terms and how to avoid defaulting. You’ll also be required to sign a promissory note before accepting the loan.
- Accept your financial aid offer. The amount of aid you’re offered will vary by school. Once you’ve compared offers and chosen a school, contact the school to accept the financial aid. If it includes federal student loans, the school will tell you how to accept them.
- ​​When you get your results, you’ll find out whether you qualify for subsidized or unsubsidized federal student loans. Subsidized loans are for undergraduate students with financial needs.
- If you qualify, the U.S. Department of Education will pay your interest costs while you attend school and during deferment. You pay all interest costs with an unsubsidized loan, and that interest starts accruing at the time of disbursement.
- How to get a private student loan
- If you’ve hit your federal student loan borrowing limit or don’t qualify for federal financial aid, you may need to cover the remaining academic costs with a private student loan. These come from banks, credit unions and online lenders.
- In contrast to federal student loans, private student loan interest rates rely on your credit score, as does approval. The process for applying, however, is fairly simple comparatively.
- Complete the application. You’ll typically need to agree to a credit check and provide details about your school, cost of attendance, type of degree, citizenship information, Social Security number, proof of income and debt obligations. Depending on the lender, the application process can take a few minutes to a few days to complete.
- Although private student loans can be a great option when you don’t qualify for enough federal aid, federal loans are generally ideal for a few key reasons. For starters, private loans aren’t eligible for some of the borrower protections that come with federal student loans, such as income-driven payment plans. Deferment and forbearance also vary by lender, and if the loan comes with a variable interest rate, it can increase anytime during repayment.
- How to get approved for a private student loan
- Approval for a private student loan is contingent upon several factors. These include your credit score, income level and the cost of attendance at your school. To improve your chances of being approved, follow these steps:
- Improve your credit score. Make timely payments, keep your credit utilization ratio low and regularly check your credit report for any errors.
- Consider a cosigner. If you don’t have a strong credit history, consider asking a parent or other trusted individual with good credit to co-sign your loan. This can significantly increase your chances of approval and potentially get you a lower interest rate.
- You may borrow private loans to cover the remaining costs after your aid package and available funding run out. It’s important to evaluate the terms of any loan you opt to borrow, whether public or private, and understand the commitment you’re signing on for in advance. Make sure you understand repayment options and interest rates as you proceed through the loan application process.

Financial Tips:
- Shop around with multiple lenders. Compare loan amounts, interest rates, discounts, benefits, fees and repayment plans. You’ll likely have a relationship with this lender for several years, so it’s also a good idea to evaluate its hardship options in case of financial trouble later. The lender should also have good reviews and responsive customer service.

- American Express Business Blueprint™️: Best for secured line of credit
- Overview: American Express Business Blueprint™, formerly Kabbage, is a service from American Express offering lines of credit. It offers accessible eligibility requirements to apply, accepting businesses with fair credit and as little as $3,000 in average monthly revenue. Its line of credit can cater to businesses needing small loan amounts from $2,000 to $250,000.
- But instead of interest, it charges a monthly percentage of your loan balance, a fee structure that can quickly add up to more than you’d pay with other lines of credit. This line of credit offers flexible repayment terms of six, 12, 18 or 24 months.
- The total monthly fee incurred over the loan term ranges from 3.00% to 9.00% on six-month terms, 6.00% to 18.00% on 12-month terms, 9.00% to 27.00% on 18-month terms and 12.00% to 18.00% for 24-month terms. Once approved, you’ll make a monthly payment instead of the usual daily or weekly payment schedule. And you won’t get tagged with a prepayment penalty if you pay back the loan early.
- * All businesses are unique and are subject to approval and review. The required FICO score may be higher based on your relationship with American Express, credit history, and other factors.
- America Express Business Blueprint™ works best if you need a secured business line of credit since you’ll need business assets to secure the loan. You will also need to sign a personal guarantee each time you make a draw, which guarantees that you’ll repay the loan with personal assets if needed.

- What is a business line of credit?
- A business line of credit (LOC) is a flexible loan for businesses that works like a credit card. Companies draw money from their credit lines as needed, only paying interest on the portion of money borrowed. This allows businesses to draw exactly as much as they need and only pay interest on their balance, instead of having to estimate costs ahead of time and possibly ending up short with a traditional loan.
- Business lines of credit can be revolving or non-revolving. For revolving lines of credit, as the borrower repays the amount borrowed, the lender replenishes the funds available so that they can withdraw from the credit line again. These funds can typically be accessed using a business checking account or mobile app.
- With non-revolving business lines of credit, the line of credit is set ahead of time, and once the loan is paid off, the capital cannot be accessed again, making it a bit less flexible than a revolving line of credit.
- How does a business line of credit work?
- Business lines of credit are similar to business credit cards. Both allow small businesses to access funds when needs arise instead of the lump sum a business loan would provide.
- When you take out a business line of credit, you can withdraw funds up to the credit limit during the draw period. You repay withdrawals from the line of credit over a short term, only paying interest on the amount borrowed. Interest rates on business lines of credit are typically lower than those of a business credit card.
- Lenders set credit limits and interest rates based on factors like how long the business has been running, the owner’s credit score and what the company’s annual revenue is. An LOC typically requires renewal annually and may require an annual fee on top of the usual origination fees and interest.
- Compare lenders to find the best business line of credit.To find the best loan offer for your business, you’ll want to compare several different lenders. Look at their loan interest rates, terms and repayment schedules such as weekly or monthly payments. You’ll also want to look at lenders’ eligibility requirements to make sure that your business meets these requirements before you apply.
- Apply for the loan.Work with the lender to fill out an application and provide all required documents quickly. You may need business bank statements, tax returns, business formation and personal identification documents. The lender will then review your financial statements and notify you of their loan decision.

- Pros and cons of business lines of credit
- Accessible: Online lenders often have more lenient requirements and disburse funds quickly.
- Establishes a relationship with a lender: A line of credit helps you start a relationship with a lender and build credit, which can potentially make it easier to secure additional financing in the future.
- High interest rates: Business lines of credit tend to have higher interest rates than term loans. Interest rates may also be variable, which means that the rate may rise over time based on market fluctuations.
- Short repayment terms: You may have a short repayment term, such as 12 or 18 months. Its short repayment term may have a higher payment and a more aggressive repayment schedule, such as daily or weekly payments, than long-term loans.
- Lower loan limits: The credit on a line of credit tends to be much lower than what you can get with a traditional loan, making it a less viable option for big business expenses.
- Alternatives to business lines of credit
- Term loan
- A term loan disperses all funding in a single lump-sum payment. You are required to repay the loan with interest over a set period of time. Term loans are often ideal for making large purchases since they don’t operate as a revolving line of credit. They also tend to offer higher loan amounts than a small business line of credit.

- You get an advance on your credit or debit card sales, which you repay with a percentage of your sales. Rates can be high, largely because merchant cash advances are able to skirt usury laws. These state laws limit the interest rates lenders can charge for other products, including loans. Since MCAs aren’t technically loans, their interest rates could even reach the triple digits.

- If you’re experiencing a long-term cash shortage, you may want to look into zero-debt financing, a type of financing that doesn’t use debt to fund your business. You can also try cutting expenses or increasing business revenue rather than getting a business loan.
- Where to get a business line of credit
- You can find lines of credit with both traditional and online lenders.
- Traditional banks or credit unions: At these lenders, you can talk to an employee face to face and get all your questions answered. But these lenders have more strict requirements like a long time in business, higher annual revenue or credit score. These may offer more traditional secured loan types, which can lead to potentially lower rates.
- Online banks/financial services companies: Online lenders operate entirely digitally and allow you to manage your loan through apps or online portals. They can offer more convenience and have more relaxed eligibility requirements. They just don’t offer the face-to-face experience some people prefer.
- To choose the lender that’s right for you, ask how your business measures up against its requirements. For instance, if you’re a newer business, have lower credit or have smaller annual revenue, online lenders may be best for your situation. It’s also important to assess if you value an office right up the road or an online-only experience. Bankrate can help you find lenders and evaluate them based on what your business needs.

- All businesses are unique and are subject to review and approval
- The repayment process varies from lender to lender. With some LOCs, you can make interest-only payments during your draw period. Then, you make repayments during the repayment period of six months to five years after the draw period ends. Other lenders treat each draw like an individual term loan — you have a set period to repay each draw you make, which could be weeks or months long.
- Secured vs. unsecured business lines of credit
- The difference between a secured business line of credit and an unsecured line of credit is whether you back the loan with cash or collateral. A secured business line of credit requires that you back your loan with some sort of collateral, such as business equipment, real estate or personal property such as your house. Secured lines of credit will often require this in the form of a personal guarantee. If you default on your line of credit balance, the lender will be able to seize the collateral and liquidate it in order to pay back the loan.
- Many lenders offer cash secured business lines of credit, where you put down a cash deposit in order to secure a line of credit. If the balance is paid off, you’ll receive the deposit back. If you have a lower credit score, are a new business or don’t meet the revenue requirements for a traditional loan or line of credit, secured business lines of credit can offer you a way to get flexible funding and improve your credit score as you pay down the balance.
- Business line of credit vs. business loan
- The key difference between a business loan and a business line of credit is flexibility in funding. While a business loan offers financing in a predetermined lump sum, a business line of credit allows you to withdraw as much or as little funds you need within the credit limits over the draw period. With a business loan, you receive a certain amount of money agreed upon by you and the lender in a lump sum, which you have to immediately make payments on and that will immediately accumulate interest whether or not you end up using all the capital. Business loans generally require a higher minimum credit score, time in business and revenue amount, while offering loan amounts ranging from $5,000 to millions of dollars, depending on the lender. A business line of credit, on the other hand, allows you to withdraw only as much as you need within the draw period and credit limit. If you take out a line of credit up to $10,000, for example, and draw only $2,000, you only need to pay the balance and interest on the $2,000. This makes a line of credit better for businesses with flexible funding needs in smaller amounts. Lenders generally also allow you to make interest-only payments during the draw period, giving you more flexibility with the payments.
- Should I get a business loan or a business line of credit?
- Which type of funding you get will depend on your business’ individual needs. While there is no right answer, there are some criteria to consider when choosing between a business loan and a business line of credit.
- You might want to get a business loan if:
- You might want to get a business line of credit if:
- You plan on using the credit for future funding
- Want to build your credit score
- You don’t qualify for a traditional loan
- Keep in mind that you can have both a business loan and a line of credit at the same time, so long as you meet the qualifications for approval and you don’t rack up too high of a debt-to-income ratio.
- How to get a business line of credit
- Calculate how much you need to borrow.Consider how much funding you need to cover the business expenses you have. But you also need to ensure that you can handle the business loan payments. Use Bankrate’s business loan calculator to figure how much you can afford to pay monthly before you sign any loan agreements.
- Request business and personal credit reports.You’ll want to request your credit reports so that you can apply with lenders that will accept your credit. You may also want to look over your credit report to see what lenders will look at and to see if you can improve your credit. For example, you may spot an error on your report that you can request a correction to boost your score, or you might pay off other debts.
- Online lenders tend to be faster than traditional lenders when approving lines of credit for businesses. You might get approved within one to two business days. Traditional lenders may take weeks to complete the underwriting process. Having all of your paperwork in order and submitted can dramatically speed up the process.

- How long does it take to get approved for a business line of credit?
- How much will a business line of credit cost?
- The total cost of a business line of credit consists of the amount you borrow, the interest and any fees charged for the credit line. Some examples of fees you may see with a business line of credit are draw fees every time you withdraw funds, an annual maintenance fee to renew the line of credit or a monthly service fee to keep the line open. In some cases, you’ll pay an origination fee to open the line of credit. Before opening a business line of credit, you'll want to compare total costs for a few different options to determine which is best for your business.

- What can you use a business line of credit for?
- You can use a small business line of credit for nearly any purchase as long as it stays within the credit limit. But because the credit limit refreshes as you pay back the loan, you may want to keep it free to use for unexpected expenses or cash flow gaps. For this reason, many business owners use business credit lines to cover small expenses that they can pay back easily.
